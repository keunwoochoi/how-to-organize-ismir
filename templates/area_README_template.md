## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
- General Advice:
- This Year's Choices (contextualized to current year):

## Rationale & Consequences
- Why this matters:
- If inconsistent / not done:
- Otherwise / alternatives:

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make
- Use this section to document major decision areas for the topic, with clear ownership and reasoning. For each topic, add subsections:
  - Context (why this matters; constraints)
  - Decision owner(s) and stakeholders
  - Options considered
  - This year's decision (facts; who decided; when)
  - Pros/Cons and consequences
  - Open questions / follow-ups
  - Recommendations for next year
- Common topic categories (adapt per area):
  - Process design (e.g., review/screening cadence, timelines, milestones)
  - Tools and systems (e.g., submission/review platforms, infrastructure)
  - Capacity and format (limits, space/equipment, hybrid/virtual policies)
  - Communications (CFP/announcements, reminders, closure criteria)
  - Policy specifics (media specs, accessibility, DEI, eligibility)
  - Resourcing (volunteers, staffing, roles, training)

## Suggested Timeline
- Use relative months (e.g., Month -8 to -6) assuming an October conference; provide concrete examples tied to these phases. Always use the actual months too together. E.g., "Month -8 to -6 (Feb to Apr)".
- Month -6 to -4:
- Month -4 to -2:
- Month -2 to -1:
- Week -4 to -1:
- Conference Week:
- Post-conference:

## Dependencies & Blockers

## Stakeholders
- List key individuals/teams with brief explanations of their roles and collaboration points (e.g., "General Chairs for policy alignment").
- Include potential cross-area integrations (e.g., Jam Session Hosts for collaborative events) to highlight interdependencies.

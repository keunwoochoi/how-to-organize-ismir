## DEI Chairs Guide

## Goal
DEI Chairs promote equitable access, a safe environment, and inclusive participation for all ISMIR attendees. They steward policies, programs, and communications that reduce barriers and support underrepresented participants across in-person and virtual experiences.

- Foster inclusion and psychological safety across all conference touchpoints
- Reduce structural barriers (accessibility, financial, caregiving) in collaboration with other chairs

## Chairs' Goal
DEI Chairs align inclusion goals with program and logistics, coordinate targeted support, and advise other chairs on inclusive practices. They focus on clear policy, proactive communication, and practical interventions with measurable impact.

- Lead key DEI initiatives and advise on inclusive policies and processes
- Coordinate with Registration, Local Org, Newcomer, Grants (optional), Web/Design, Virtual, and Social Media

## Scope & Responsibilities
DEI Chairs drive inclusion strategy and practical execution while partnering with area owners. They do not own all outcomes, but ensure DEI considerations are integrated and feasible.

- Define/update Code of Conduct; maintain reporting and response processes
- Advise on accessibility accommodations (venues, captions, mobility, sensory), childcare/lactation support
- Provide guidance on inclusive communications (pronouns, name preferences, language)
- Partner with Registration to collect access needs in forms; ensure follow-through with Local Org
- Collaborate with Newcomer Initiative and WIMIR organizers on inclusive programming and outreach
- Optionally coordinate with Grants on criteria and outreach if priorities call for it (not required)
- Support photo/video consent guidance in coordination with Local Org and Virtual Chairs

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes embedding DEI throughout processes, while yearly choices reflect local needs and budget.

- General Advice
  - Treat DEI as a cross-functional practice, not a standalone event; integrate early in planning
  - Make policies specific, simple, and visible (Code of Conduct; consent; accommodations)
  - Use opt-in/opt-out patterns that are easy to follow (e.g., visual indicators for photo consent)
  - Collect access needs early in registration; follow up 1:1 for sensitive requests
  - Prefer checklists and templates over ad-hoc decisions; publish contacts for confidential reports
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Photo consent: Yellow lanyards for "do not photograph me"; photos shared via Google Photos (preview/sharing, not archival)
  - Inclusivity programs: Newcomer squads and WIMIR events coordinated across teams
  - Grants: Primary ownership with Grants Chairs; DEI collaboration optional and context-dependent

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear, actionable DEI processes reduce uncertainty and prevent exclusion. Without them, attendees face hidden barriers, trust erodes, and organizers absorb last-minute crises.

- Why it matters: Predictable, respectful processes enable equitable participation
- If inconsistent/not done: Missed accommodations, privacy violations, unsafe environments, reputational harm
- Alternatives: Centralized vs distributed ownership; opt-in vs opt-out approaches

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make
Each topic includes context, owners, options, this year's decision (if available), pros/cons, and recommendations.

### 1) Code of Conduct and Reporting
- Context: Set behavioral expectations; define safe, confidential reporting and response
- Decision owner(s): General Chairs + DEI Chairs
- Options: Public named contacts vs anonymous form; on-site ombudsperson vs organizing-team triage
- 2025 decision: Not documented here; ensure named contacts and rapid escalation path
- Pros/Cons: Anonymous lowers barrier but reduces detail; named contacts build trust but need training
- Recommendations: Publish short CoC; provide both named contacts and anonymous form; document escalation SLAs

### 2) Accessibility Accommodations
- Context: Mobility, sensory, hearing/vision support; dietary needs; quiet rooms; signage; captions/ASR
- Decision owner(s): DEI Chairs (advise), Local Org (execute), Registration (collect data), Virtual Chairs (for captions/streaming)
- Options: Central request form vs registration fields; proactive vs on-demand support
- 2025 decision: Not fully documented; align with Local Org and Virtual planning cycles
- Pros/Cons: Proactive planning reduces last-minute costs; on-demand is flexible but unreliable
- Recommendations: Add access-needs fields to registration; maintain an accommodations tracker with owners and due dates

### 3) Childcare and Lactation Support
- Context: Caregiver support increases participation and equity
- Decision owner(s): Local Org (logistics), DEI (advice), General Chairs (budget)
- Options: On-site childcare vendor vs stipend; dedicated lactation room vs ad-hoc space
- 2025 decision: Not documented here
- Pros/Cons: On-site care increases access but requires liability checks; stipends offer flexibility
- Recommendations: Decide by Month -6; publish early; coordinate signage and private space booking

### 4) Pronouns and Names
- Context: Respect identity across badges, registration, and online platforms
- Decision owner(s): Registration (badges), Web/Design (site), Virtual (platform), DEI (guidance)
- Options: Badge pronoun fields; display preferences; pronunciation guides
- 2025 decision: Not documented here
- Pros/Cons: Supports inclusion; requires data hygiene and privacy considerations
- Recommendations: Offer optional pronoun field; ensure staff training; avoid forced disclosure

### 5) Photo and Video Consent
- Context: Balance documentation with privacy and safety; session-specific sharing needs vary
- Decision owner(s): Local Org (on-site photo policy), Virtual (recording/sharing), DEI (advice)
- Options: Visual opt-out (colored lanyards) vs form-based lists; blanket consent vs session-specific
- 2025 decision: Yellow lanyards for no-photo; session recording consent managed by relevant chairs
- Pros/Cons: Visual cues are simple; blanket rules are easy but may violate expectations
- Recommendations: Publish simple on-site photo policy; maintain session-level consent matrix for recordings

### 6) Inclusive Outreach and Programming
- Context: Encourage participation by underrepresented groups and newcomers
- Decision owner(s): Newcomer Initiative, WIMIR organizers, Social Media, DEI (advice)
- Options: Dedicated sessions vs integrated activities; mentor programs; targeted outreach
- 2025 decision: Newcomer squads and WIMIR activities executed via respective chairs
- Pros/Cons: Dedicated events create safe focus; integrated efforts broaden reach
- Recommendations: Provide templates for inclusive calls; coordinate calendars to avoid conflicts

### 7) Grants Alignment (Optional Collaboration)
- Context: Align inclusivity priorities with grant eligibility and outreach when needed
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs; DEI collaboration optional, based on yearly priorities
- Options: Co-define criteria vs advisory input only; targeted outreach to underrepresented groups
- 2025 decision: Grants led by Grants Chairs; DEI coordination minimal and context-specific
- Pros/Cons: Alignment can boost impact; co-ownership risks confusion
- Recommendations: Clarify collaboration mode early; avoid duplicative processes

## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)
A phased timeline ensures DEI is embedded early and operationally supported.

- Month -8 to -6 (Feb to Apr)
  - Update Code of Conduct and reporting channels; identify named contacts and backup
  - Add access-needs fields to registration; define data-sharing flow with Local Org
- Month -6 to -4 (Apr to Jun)
  - Decide childcare/lactation support model and vendors; budget approval
  - Draft photo/recording consent policies with Local Org and Virtual; plan visual indicators
- Month -3 to -2 (Jul to Aug)
  - Confirm accommodations and accessibility setups; publish concise attendee guidance
  - Coordinate inclusive outreach with Newcomer/WIMIR; prepare on-site signage/materials
- Week -4 to -1 (Sep)
  - Reconfirm contacts and escalation SLAs; brief volunteers on DEI practices
  - Finalize consent matrix for recordings; verify quiet room and lactation room readiness
- Conference Week (Oct)
  - Operate reporting channels; monitor accommodations; support session-specific consent
  - Conduct daily check-ins with Local Org and Virtual for DEI-related issues
- Post-conference (+1â€“2 weeks) (Oct to Nov)
  - Debrief; document incidents (confidentially) and outcomes; update guide
  - Share lessons learned with General Chairs; plan improvements

## Dependencies & Blockers
- Registration data sharing and timely access-needs collection
- Local Org and Virtual vendor capacity (captions, mobility aids, room allocations)
- Budget approvals for childcare, accessibility services
- Legal/liability considerations for vendors and reporting process

## Stakeholders
Clear collaboration points ensure inclusion is implemented effectively.

- General Chairs: Set policy direction; approve budgets; arbitrate sensitive issues
- Local Organization: Execute accommodations, quiet/lactation rooms, signage; on-site photo policy
- Registration: Collect access needs; manage pronoun/name preferences on badges
- Virtual Chairs: Recording/streaming consent, captions/ASR, remote accessibility
- Web & Design: Publish policies clearly; inclusive language and structure
- Social Media: Inclusive announcements; promote DEI programs and resources
- Newcomer Initiative: Joint programs and outreach for first-time attendees
- WIMIR Organizers: Coordinate events and communications; broaden outreach
- Grants Chairs (optional collaboration): Align on outreach if priorities call for it; DEI does not own grants
- Industry Chairs: Coordinate if DEI-linked events or sponsorships are planned

## Caveats / Pitfalls
- Token efforts without operational backing fail; pair policy with owners and timelines
- Late consent decisions create risk; decide early and document
- Over-collection of sensitive data without need; minimize and protect data
- Unclear reporting paths erode trust; train responders and publish contacts

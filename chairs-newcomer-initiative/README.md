# Newcomer Initiative Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Newcomer Initiative fosters a welcoming environment for first and second-time ISMIR attendees, enhancing their experience through mentorship, networking, and inclusive activities. It promotes long-term engagement by building connections and providing support for underrepresented and novice participants.

- Welcome and support newcomers through squads, mentoring, and dedicated sessions.
- Promote inclusivity and community building for sustained participation in MIR.

## Chairs' Goal
Newcomer Chairs must design engaging programs, recruit mentors, and facilitate interactions to ensure newcomers feel valued and integrated. Their focus is on accessibility, feedback, and collaboration with DEI efforts.

- Organize newcomer squads, mentoring programs, and welcome sessions.
- Collaborate with DEI for inclusive events and promotions.
- Recruit and train mentors; promote via Slack and social media.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve program design, participant management, and event coordination to create a supportive newcomer experience. Chairs handle pairings, sessions, and feedback while aligning with conference inclusion goals.

- Define newcomer programs, squad formats, and mentoring structures.
- Recruit mentors and pair with newcomers; manage applications.
- Organize welcome sessions, meetups, and DEI-integrated events.
- Promote programs via Slack, social media, and conference channels.
- Collect feedback and report on participation and impact.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes scalable, inclusive programs adaptable to conference size, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific activities and tools. This separation allows evolution based on feedback and resources.

- General Advice
  - Use simple pairing algorithms for squads to ensure diversity.
  - Integrate with DEI for broader inclusion; promote early and often.
  - Collect feedback post-event to refine programs.
  - Recruit experienced attendees as mentors with clear guidelines.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Programs: Newcomer Squad (pairing), mentoring, WIMIR sessions.
  - Tools: Slack promotions; Google Forms for applications.
  - Events: DEI sessions, regional satellites (e.g., LAMIR).

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear structures and promotions ensure high participation and satisfaction, preventing newcomers from feeling isolated. Inconsistencies can lead to low uptake, mentor burnout, or missed opportunities for inclusion.

- Why consistency matters: Builds trust and predictability for participants and mentors.
- If inconsistent/not done: Newcomers may disengage; programs may lack structure.
- Alternatives: Peer-led vs chair-led; virtual vs in-person focus.

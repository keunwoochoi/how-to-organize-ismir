# Web & Design Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Web & Design Program provides a professional, accessible website and materials that enhance conference visibility and user experience. It ensures intuitive navigation, timely updates, and engaging design for all attendees.

- Develop and maintain the conference website, materials, and digital assets.
- Ensure usability, accessibility, and timely information dissemination.

## Chairs' Goal
Web & Design Chairs must create user-friendly interfaces, manage content, and integrate features. Their focus is on functionality, aesthetics, and responsiveness to user needs.

- Design and build the conference website and related platforms.
- Manage content updates, registrations, and integrations.
- Coordinate with other chairs for feature requests and updates.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve website development, content management, and technical support to ensure reliable and engaging digital presence. Chairs handle designs, updates, and integrations while aligning with conference branding.

- Design and develop the conference website and mobile responsiveness.
- Manage content (CFPs, schedules, registrations); integrate tools.
- Coordinate with chairs for features (e.g., submission systems, social media).
- Ensure accessibility and security; handle domain and hosting.
- Collect feedback and report on site metrics and improvements.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes user-centric, scalable designs adaptable to tech, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific features and integrations. This separation allows evolution with web trends.

- General Advice
  - Use responsive designs; prioritize accessibility (WCAG).
  - Integrate with tools (e.g., registration, submissions); test across devices.
  - Update content regularly; monitor for security.
  - Collect user feedback for iterative improvements.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Platforms: Custom site; integrated with registration and submissions.
  - Features: Mobile-responsive; accessibility features; real-time updates.

## Rationale & Consequences
Professional and accessible web presence enhances user engagement and conference reputation. Inconsistencies can lead to poor usability or security issues.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures reliable access and professional image.
- If inconsistent/not done: User frustration; missed registrations; security risks.
- Alternatives: Third-party platforms; static sites; outsourced design.

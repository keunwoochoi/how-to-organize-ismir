# Scientific Program Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Scientific Program delivers high-quality paper presentations, fostering knowledge exchange and advancing MIR research. It structures the core conference content, ensuring rigorous review and engaging sessions for attendees.

- Manage paper submissions, reviews, and selections for the main program.
- Build a balanced schedule of presentations, posters, and awards.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve CFP issuance, review management, and program construction to ensure academic quality and diversity. Chairs handle submissions, selections, and sessions while coordinating with other chairs.

- Define CFP themes and guidelines; manage submission platform.
- Recruit and assign reviewers; oversee review process and meta-reviews.
- Select papers for oral/poster; handle acceptances and rejections.
- Coordinate award nominations (e.g., Best Paper, Outstanding Reviewers).
- Build program schedule; integrate with tutorials and other sessions.
- Decide how to implement the open reviews policy following community guidelines.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes fair, scalable processes adaptable to submission volume, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tools and integrations. This separation allows evolution with conference growth.

- General Advice
  - Use double-blind review; recruit diverse reviewers for bias reduction.
  - Set clear acceptance criteria.
  - Coordinate early with subcommittees for awards.
  - Integrate with overall schedule for smooth flow.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Tools: CMT for submissions and reviews; Slack for discussions.
  - Process: Double-blind; meta-reviews; Best Paper and Outstanding Reviewers committees. Opt-out author only for open reviews.


## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) CFP Themes and Submission Guidelines
- Context: Align with conference theme while attracting diverse submissions and keeping consistency with previous ISMIRs.
- Decision owner(s): Scientific Program Chairs in coordination with General Chairs.
- 2025 decision: Aligned with "Harmony of Tradition & Modernity"; standard formats.

### 2) Review Process and Tools
- 2025 decision: Double-blind; CMT platform. 
- Pros/Cons: Double-blind reduces bias; CMT platform inherits from previous ISMIRs (you don't start from scratch yay!). It still requires setup though.
- Priorities: recruit reviewers EARLY, and PLENTY of them. Some numbers for reference:
    - 2024: 256 reviewers, 70 meta-reviewers for 346 papers.
    - 2025: 269 reviewers, 77 meta-reviewers for 278 papers. Initial submission 324 but some papers submitted abstract but not PDF, and some got desk rejected.
    - 99 papers accepted with the acceptance rate of 35.6%, the lowest so far ðŸ˜¢ (followed by 35.84% in ISMIR 2024)
  
### 3) Award Nominations and Committees
- Context: Recognize excellence and encourage participation.
- Decision owner(s): Scientific Program Chairs (coordinate with subcommittees).
- Options: Committee-led vs chair-selected; multiple vs single awards.
- 2025 decision: Subcommittee for Best Paper; Outstanding Reviewers.
- Pros/Cons: Committee ensures fairness; chair-selected is efficient.
- Recommendations: Define criteria; avoid conflicts.

### 4) Program Schedule and Integration
- Context: Build cohesive schedule without conflicts.
- Decision owner(s): Scientific Program Chairs (coordinate with Tutorials, Industry).
- Options: Parallel vs sequential (single track); themed vs mixed sessions.
- 2025 decision: Mixed sessions; integrated with other programs.
- Pros/Cons: Parallel increases options; sequential ensures focus.

### 5) Author Support and Notifications
- Context: Ensure smooth communication and logistics.
- Decision owner(s): Scientific Program Chairs.
- 2025 decision: Platform notifications; early for planning.
- Pros/Cons: Automated is efficient; personal builds relationships.
- Recommendations: Provide clear instructions; follow up.

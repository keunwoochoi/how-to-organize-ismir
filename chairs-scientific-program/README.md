# Scientific Program Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Scientific Program delivers high-quality paper presentations, fostering knowledge exchange and advancing MIR research. It structures the core conference content, ensuring rigorous review and engaging sessions for attendees.

- Manage paper submissions, reviews, and selections for the main program.
- Build a balanced schedule of presentations, posters, and awards.

## Chairs' Goal
Scientific Program Chairs must oversee the review process, select papers, and organize sessions for maximum impact. Their focus is on fairness, efficiency, and integration with other program elements.

- Define CFP and manage submission/review system.
- Evaluate papers; select for presentation and posters.
- Coordinate with subcommittees for awards and recognitions.
- Build program schedule; handle author notifications and logistics.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve CFP issuance, review management, and program construction to ensure academic quality and diversity. Chairs handle submissions, selections, and sessions while coordinating with other chairs.

- Define CFP themes and guidelines; manage submission platform.
- Recruit and assign reviewers; oversee review process and meta-reviews.
- Select papers for oral/poster; handle acceptances and rejections.
- Coordinate award nominations (e.g., Best Paper, Outstanding Reviewers).
- Build program schedule; integrate with tutorials and other sessions.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes fair, scalable processes adaptable to submission volume, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tools and integrations. This separation allows evolution with conference growth.

- General Advice
  - Use double-blind review; recruit diverse reviewers for bias reduction.
  - Set clear acceptance criteria; balance oral/poster ratios.
  - Coordinate early with subcommittees for awards.
  - Integrate with overall schedule for smooth flow.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Tools: OpenReview for submissions and reviews; Slack for discussions.
  - Process: Double-blind; meta-reviews; Best Paper and Outstanding Reviewers committees.
  - Schedule: Integrated with tutorials and industry; hybrid considerations.
  - Online fun-fact sharing: Asked for up to 3 fun facts from attendees; worked well and more useful than expected for community building.

## Rationale & Consequences
Rigorous processes ensure high-quality content and fair opportunities, maintaining conference reputation. Inconsistencies can lead to biased selections, author dissatisfaction, or program imbalances.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable review and clear expectations for authors.
- If inconsistent/not done: Biased outcomes; low-quality program; author appeals.
- Alternatives: Single-blind review; automated assignments; joint sessions.

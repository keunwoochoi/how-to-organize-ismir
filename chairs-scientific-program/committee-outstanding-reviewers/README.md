# Outstanding Reviewers Committee Guide

## Goal
The Outstanding Reviewers Award recognizes exceptional contributions to the peer review process, promoting quality and encouraging volunteerism in ISMIR. It highlights reviewers' efforts in maintaining high standards for research evaluation.

- Identify and honor reviewers who provide outstanding feedback and service.
- Encourage high-quality reviewing and community participation.

## Chairs' Goal
Committee members must collect nominations, evaluate reviewers, and select awardees fairly. Their focus is on transparency, timeliness, and celebrating dedication to the review process.

- Collect nominations for outstanding reviewers.
- Evaluate based on criteria; select and notify awardees.
- Coordinate presentations and acknowledgments.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve nomination management, evaluation, and award delivery to ensure recognition of review excellence. Committee handles processes, selections, and ceremonies while aligning with conference standards.

- Solicit nominations from Program Chairs and reviewers.
- Evaluate nominees based on quality, timeliness, and helpfulness.
- Select awardees; notify and prepare for presentations.
- Coordinate with closing session for announcements.
- Report on selections and encourage future nominations.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes fair, inclusive selection adaptable to review volume, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific process and criteria. This separation allows scalability for varying submission numbers.

- General Advice
  - Use multiple sources for nominations; evaluate holistically.
  - Ensure diversity in selections; maintain confidentiality.
  - Coordinate early for presentations; track metrics.
  - Promote reviewing culture through recognition.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Nominations: From Program Chairs; committee review.
  - Criteria: Quality, timeliness, helpfulness; 5-10 awardees.
  - Presentation: During closing; certificates and mentions.

## Rationale & Consequences
Fair processes ensure recognition motivates reviewers and upholds standards. Inconsistencies can lead to perceptions of bias or reduced volunteerism.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable evaluation and clear expectations for nominees.
- If inconsistent/not done: Reduced reviewer motivation; perceived unfairness; lower quality reviews.
- Alternatives: Automated metrics; public nominations; tiered awards.

# Tutorial Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Tutorial Program provides educational sessions on MIR topics, bridging foundational concepts with advanced techniques to benefit both newcomers and experts. It enhances conference value by offering accessible, high-quality learning opportunities aligned with the conference theme.

- Organize pre-conference tutorials on MIR topics, emphasizing inclusivity and relevance.
- Promote knowledge sharing and skill-building for diverse audiences.

## Chairs' Goal
Tutorial Chairs must curate a balanced program, manage submissions, and ensure smooth delivery in a hybrid format. Their focus is on selection, coordination, and delivering engaging, educational content.

- Curate and select tutorial proposals that align with the conference theme and audience needs.
- Manage the submission, review, and notification process.
- Coordinate logistics for hybrid delivery and presenter support.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve CFP issuance, review management, and event coordination to ensure educational quality and inclusivity. Chairs handle selections, communications, and logistics while aligning with conference goals.

- Define CFP themes and guidelines; publish calls and manage submissions.
- Review proposals based on criteria like relevance, originality, and inclusivity.
- Select and notify presenters; handle revisions and final preparations.
- Coordinate venue, tools, and hybrid formats for tutorials.
- Ensure accessibility and alignment with conference diversity initiatives.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice promotes inclusive, high-quality tutorials adaptable to themes, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific focus and logistics. This separation allows evolution based on conference priorities.

- General Advice
  - Align with conference theme; encourage introductory and inclusive topics.
  - Use weighted criteria for review; ensure complementarity across sessions.
  - Provide clear guidelines for hybrid delivery and presenter support.
  - Promote diversity in presenters and topics.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Theme: Harmony of Tradition & Modernity; 6 accepted tutorials (e.g., Differentiable Physical Modeling, Explainable AI).
  - Format: 3-hour sessions; hybrid with in-person presenter; email submissions.
  - Review: Criteria include relevance, suitability for general audience, originality.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear criteria and processes ensure high-quality, relevant tutorials that engage attendees. Inconsistencies can lead to mismatched content, low satisfaction, or reduced educational impact.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures fair selection and clear expectations for submitters.
- If inconsistent/not done: Tutorials may not fit audience or theme; low attendance or quality.
- Alternatives: Peer review panels; virtual-only formats; open calls without themes.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) CFP Themes and Alignment
- Context: Balance conference theme with broad appeal and inclusivity.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs).
- Options: Theme-specific vs general; introductory vs advanced focus.
- 2025 decision: Aligned with "Harmony of Tradition & Modernity"; encouraged inclusive topics.
- Pros/Cons: Theme focus builds cohesion; general increases diversity.
- Recommendations: Survey past attendees; pilot theme variations.

### 2) Submission and Review Process
- Context: Manage volume and ensure rigorous yet inclusive selection.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs.
- Options: Email vs platform; chair-led vs panel review.
- 2025 decision: Email PDF submissions; chair-led review with criteria.
- Pros/Cons: Email is simple; platform scales better but adds overhead.
- Recommendations: Use rubrics; anonymize where possible.

### 3) Format and Logistics
- Context: Ensure hybrid delivery suits educational goals.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs (coordinate with Local Org, Virtual Chairs).
- Options: Fully in-person vs hybrid; fixed duration vs flexible.
- 2025 decision: 3-hour hybrid; at least one in-person presenter.
- Pros/Cons: Hybrid increases access; in-person ensures quality.
- Recommendations: Test hybrid tools; provide presenter guidelines.

### 4) Presenter Support and Diversity
- Context: Support presenters for successful delivery.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs (coordinate with DEI Chairs).
- Options: Training sessions vs guidelines; diversity quotas vs merit-based.
- 2025 decision: Guidelines provided; diversity encouraged.
- Pros/Cons: Training builds skills; guidelines are efficient.
- Recommendations: Offer rehearsals; promote diverse applicants.

### 5) Integration with Conference Schedule
- Context: Fit tutorials without conflicting with main program.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs (coordinate with Scientific Program).
- Options: Pre-conference vs integrated; parallel vs sequential.
- 2025 decision: Pre-conference Sunday; parallel sessions.
- Pros/Cons: Pre-conference avoids conflicts; integrated leverages attendance.
- Recommendations: Early scheduling; monitor overlaps.

### 6) Evaluation and Improvements
- Context: Assess tutorial impact for future enhancements.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs.
- Options: Surveys vs informal; post-event vs ongoing.
- 2025 decision: Post-event surveys; internal debriefs.
- Pros/Cons: Surveys provide data; informal is flexible.
- Recommendations: Standardize metrics; share with chairs.

### 7) Recording and YouTube Archiving Consent
- Context: Tutorials have educational value for broader community but require presenter consent.
- Decision owner(s): Tutorial Chairs (coordinate with Virtual Chairs).
- Options: Blanket consent vs case-by-case; opt-in vs opt-out; pre-conference vs post-conference consent.
- 2025 decision: Asked presenters for YouTube upload consent post-conference; only uploaded with explicit agreement.
- Pros/Cons: Post-conference consent is simple but slows archiving; pre-conference consent streamlines process but requires upfront planning.
- Recommendations: Obtain recording/sharing consent DURING tutorial proposal/acceptance phase – include consent checkbox in acceptance form. This is much easier than retroactive requests and allows for earlier archiving. Make clear distinction between "recording for conference access" vs "public YouTube archiving" as some presenters may be comfortable with one but not the other.

## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)
A phased timeline ensures timely preparation and execution, aligning with conference planning. Early CFP allows for selection, while later phases focus on logistics.

- Month -8 to -6 (Feb to Apr)
  - Define themes and prepare CFP; align with conference.
  - Announce CFP; open submissions.
- Month -6 to -4 (Apr to Jun)
  - Review proposals; select and notify presenters.
  - Handle revisions; coordinate logistics.
- Month -3 to -2 (Jul to Aug)
  - Finalize presenter support; prepare materials.
  - Test hybrid setups; recruit moderators if needed.
- Month -1 to 0 (Conference week) (Sep to Oct)
  - Run tutorials; facilitate sessions.
  - Support presenters; handle issues.
- Post-conference (+1–2 weeks) (Oct to Nov)
  - Collect feedback; debrief; update guide.

## Dependencies & Blockers

# Unconference Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Unconference fosters open, participant-driven discussions on MIR topics, promoting community engagement and idea exchange. It provides a flexible forum for timely issues, complementing structured sessions with interactive, collaborative formats.

- Organize participant-led discussions on emerging MIR topics and community concerns.
- Encourage broad participation and follow-up in ongoing channels.

## Chairs' Goal
Unconference Chairs must facilitate topic selection, manage logistics, and ensure productive discussions. Their focus is on accessibility, moderation, and creating an inclusive space for diverse voices.

- Design and facilitate the unconference format, including topic voting and group management.
- Coordinate with other sessions for timing and venue.
- Capture summaries and enable follow-up discussions.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve event design, participant engagement, and post-event follow-up to maximize discussion quality and impact. Chairs handle facilitation, logistics, and community building.

- Define unconference format, rules, and topic submission process.
- Facilitate topic proposals, voting, and group assignments.
- Moderate discussions; capture summaries and key insights.
- Coordinate venue, timing, and integrations with other sessions.
- Enable follow-up via Slack or other channels.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes flexible, engaging formats adaptable to attendance, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific logistics and topics. This separation allows evolution based on participant feedback.

- General Advice
  - Use voting for topics to ensure relevance and participation.
  - Provide separate rooms for groups; consider evening timing with food for better engagement.
  - Capture summaries and continue discussions online.
  - Integrate with conference schedule without conflicts.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Format: Post-LBD; 70 attendees; 3 topics (Ethics, Safety, Copyright).
  - Logistics: Main room; summaries shared; Slack channels for follow-up.
  - Improvements: Avoid immediate post-LBD; use separate rooms.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear facilitation ensures productive discussions and broad participation, preventing disengagement or poor outcomes. Inconsistencies can lead to low attendance or unresolved issues.

- Why consistency matters: Maintains fairness and focus in topic selection.
- If inconsistent/not done: Discussions may lack structure; low participation.
- Alternatives: Fully online; themed vs open topics; moderator-led vs self-organized.

# Industry Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Industry Program fosters collaboration between academia and industry by facilitating sponsor engagements, networking events, and knowledge sharing. It bridges MIR research with practical applications, enhancing conference value through sponsorships, presentations, and career opportunities.

- Organize sponsor sessions, booths, presentations, and networking to connect industry with the MIR community.
- Promote industry-academia interactions through meetups, job boards, and lightning talks.

## Chairs' Goal
Industry Chairs must manage sponsor relations, execute events flawlessly, and maximize value for both sponsors and attendees. Their focus is on coordination, compliance, and creating meaningful interactions that support long-term partnerships.

- Secure and manage sponsorships, ensuring benefits delivery and compliance.
- Organize industry sessions, panels, and meetups for networking and knowledge exchange.
- Facilitate career opportunities via job boards, CV pools, and presentations.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties encompass sponsor management, event organization, and stakeholder coordination to ensure smooth operations and mutual benefits. Chairs handle logistics, communications, and policy enforcement while aligning with conference goals.

- Define sponsorship tiers and benefits; publish guidelines and deadlines.
- Manage sponsor communications, booth assignments, and presentation logistics.
- Organize industry sessions, panels, and meetups, including lightning talks.
- Coordinate job boards, CV pools, and networking opportunities.
- Ensure compliance with policies, deadlines, and venue constraints.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice promotes fairness, efficiency, and inclusivity in sponsor and event management, while this year's choices address 2025's specific logistics and formats. This separation allows adaptation to varying conference scales and resources.

- General Advice
  - Standardize presentation formats and lengths to simplify operations.
  - Use raffles for booth assignments to ensure fairness.
  - Promote job boards and CV pools through multiple channels for maximum reach.
  - Request volunteers for time management and event moderation.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Presentation lengths: 8min for platinum, 4min for silver; slides due Sep 22.
  - Booths: Raffle-based; 1-4 days based on tier.
  - Lightning Talks: 1min, 1-slide; 25 slots; apps due Sep 21.
  - Job/CV: Platinum access; shared until Oct 10.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear policies and deadlines prevent misunderstandings and ensure fair access, maintaining sponsor satisfaction and event quality. Inconsistencies can lead to disputes, missed opportunities, and reduced participation.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable treatment and smooth execution for all stakeholders.
- If inconsistent/not done: Sponsors may feel undervalued; events may overrun or lack structure.
- Alternatives: Tiered deadlines; virtual-only elements if in-person limited.

# Virtual Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Virtual Program ensures remote participation mirrors in-person experience, providing access, engagement, and inclusivity for global attendees. It extends conference reach through technology, fostering equity and broad community involvement.

- Enable seamless virtual participation in sessions, events, and networking.
- Provide technical support and platforms for remote interactions.

## Chairs' Goal
Virtual Chairs must set up platforms, manage streams, and support remote users. Their focus is on reliability, accessibility, and integration with in-person elements.

- Set up and manage virtual platforms for sessions and events.
- Provide technical support and troubleshooting for remote attendees.
- Coordinate with other chairs for hybrid integrations.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve platform management, user support, and content delivery to ensure equitable access. Chairs handle setups, monitoring, and feedback while aligning with conference tech.

- Select and configure virtual platforms (slack, miniconf).
- Manage recordings and on-demand access. (Streaming itself should be done by dedicated technical team)
- Provide support for remote users; handle Q&A and interactions.
- Coordinate with Local Org for hybrid logistics.
- Collect feedback on virtual experience and improvements.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes robust, user-friendly setups adaptable to tech, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tools and integrations. This separation allows evolution with platform advancements.

- General Advice
  - In-person attendees usually cannot interact with virtual attendees, and due to the time-zone difference and its small size, virtual attendees only have minimal interactions. 
  - Rather than real-time activities, virtual chairs can focus on something more feasible:
    - Constructing miniconf and archiving recordings
    - Support Slack as a communication channel for both in-person and virtual attendees
  - Many design choices are from the fully virtual conference era. Consider removing these:
    - Per-paper Slack channels: They have very low activities (mostly zero activities).
  - There will still be some virtual attendees, and especially, virtual presenters. Consider these:
    - Virtual-only session (I.e. they won't have poster session, and this can lead to saving time)
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Platforms: Zoom for sessions (done by the tech team & tutorial presenters); Slack for communication; YouTube for livestreaming oral sessions.
  - Support: Dedicated help desks; hybrid coordination.
  - YouTube livestream benefits: Attendees late to morning sessions can watch live remotely, then catch up on missed content by rewinding. Very practical and well-received.

## Rationale & Consequences
Reliable virtual setups ensure inclusivity and engagement, preventing exclusion of remote participants. Inconsistencies can lead to technical failures or poor experiences.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable access and reliable interactions.
- If inconsistent/not done: Remote attendees disengage; technical issues disrupt flow.
- Alternatives: Fully in-person; multi-platform; AI moderation.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) Platform Selection and Setup
- Context: Choose tools that support hybrid goals.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with Tech Chairs).
- 2025 decision: Zoom for sessions; Slack for communication; miniconf for the academic contents.

### 2) User Support and Accessibility
- Context: Assist remote users for smooth participation.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with DEI Chairs).
- Options: Help desks vs self-service; inclusive vs standard features.
- 2025 decision: Dedicated support; accessibility features.
- Pros/Cons: Support ensures usability; self-service scales.
- Recommendations: Provide guides; monitor for issues.

### 3) Recording and Sharing Consent (Session-Specific)
- Context: Different session types have varying consent needs and sensitivities.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with relevant session chairs).
- Options: Blanket consent vs session-specific; opt-in vs opt-out.
- 2025 experience: Each session type has different considerations:
  - Tutorials: Asked presenters for YouTube upload consent post-conference; only upload if they agree.
  - Industry sessions: Industry PRs may not want public sharing; requires careful negotiation. Ok to skip.
  - Keynotes: Speaker may or may not want public sharing; discuss during invitation.
  - Music program/Rencon: Performers and rights holders may have concerns; requires explicit consent.
  - Main paper sessions: Generally okay to share publicly (default for academic conferences).
- Pros/Cons: Session-specific respects varied privacy/commercial needs; blanket simplifies process but risks violations.
- Recommendations: Obtain consent BEFORE conference for ALL sessions – include recording/sharing terms in initial agreements with speakers/presenters. Create consent matrix documenting each session's sharing policy. Default to "no public sharing unless explicitly consented."


## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)
A phased timeline ensures platform readiness, aligning with tech setups. Early configuration allows for testing, while later phases focus on execution.

- Month -8 to -6 (Feb to Apr)
  - Select platforms; set up accounts and integrations.
  - Coordinate with Tech for compatibility.
- Month -6 to -4 (Apr to Jun)
  - Test streams and features; train support staff.
  - Announce to attendees; prepare guides.
- Month -3 to -2 (Jul to Aug)
  - Monitor setups; handle pre-event queries.
  - Integrate with in-person logistics.
- Month -1 to 0 (Conference week) (Sep to Oct)
  - Manage live streams; provide real-time support.
  - Record sessions; facilitate interactions.
- Post-conference (+1–2 weeks) (Oct to Nov)
  - Provide on-demand access; collect feedback; debrief.

## Dependencies & Blockers
Timely platform setup and attendee data are essential, as delays can affect access. Early coordination prevents technical issues.

- Platform access (Tech Chairs).
- Attendee registrations (Registration Chairs).
- Integration logistics (Local Org).
- Budget for tools (General Chairs).

## Stakeholders
Collaboration with key teams ensures seamless virtual experience and support. Regular communication maintains alignment.

- Tech Chairs for platform and tools.
- Local Organization for hybrid logistics.
- Session Chairs for content streaming.
- DEI Chairs for accessibility features.
- Social Media for promotions and networking.

## Caveats / Pitfalls
Technical failures or poor integration can exclude remote attendees. Proactive management ensures inclusive participation.

- Platform downtime; have backups.
- User confusion; provide clear guides.
- Accessibility gaps; test features.
- Engagement drops; monitor and intervene.

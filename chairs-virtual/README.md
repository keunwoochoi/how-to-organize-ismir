# Virtual Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Virtual Program ensures remote participation mirrors in-person experience, providing access, engagement, and inclusivity for global attendees. It extends conference reach through technology, fostering equity and broad community involvement.

- Enable seamless virtual participation in sessions, events, and networking.
- Provide technical support and platforms for remote interactions.

## Chairs' Goal
Virtual Chairs must set up platforms, manage streams, and support remote users. Their focus is on reliability, accessibility, and integration with in-person elements.

- Set up and manage virtual platforms for sessions and events.
- Provide technical support and troubleshooting for remote attendees.
- Coordinate with other chairs for hybrid integrations.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve platform management, user support, and content delivery to ensure equitable access. Chairs handle setups, monitoring, and feedback while aligning with conference tech.

- Select and configure virtual platforms (e.g., Zoom, Gather.town).
- Manage streaming, recordings, and on-demand access.
- Provide support for remote users; handle Q&A and interactions.
- Coordinate with Local Org for hybrid logistics.
- Collect feedback on virtual experience and improvements.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes robust, user-friendly setups adaptable to tech, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tools and integrations. This separation allows evolution with platform advancements.

- General Advice
  - Choose reliable platforms; test for accessibility.
  - Provide training for users; monitor for issues.

## Rationale & Consequences
Reliable virtual setups ensure inclusivity and engagement, preventing exclusion of remote participants. Inconsistencies can lead to technical failures or poor experiences.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable access and reliable interactions.
- If inconsistent/not done: Remote attendees disengage; technical issues disrupt flow.
- Alternatives: Fully in-person; multi-platform; AI moderation.

# Virtual Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Virtual Program ensures remote participation mirrors in-person experience, providing access, engagement, and inclusivity for global attendees. It extends conference reach through technology, fostering equity and broad community involvement.

- Enable seamless virtual participation in sessions, events, and networking.
- Provide technical support and platforms for remote interactions.

## Chairs' Goal
Virtual Chairs must set up platforms, manage streams, and support remote users. Their focus is on reliability, accessibility, and integration with in-person elements.

- Set up and manage virtual platforms for sessions and events.
- Provide technical support and troubleshooting for remote attendees.
- Coordinate with other chairs for hybrid integrations.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve platform management, user support, and content delivery to ensure equitable access. Chairs handle setups, monitoring, and feedback while aligning with conference tech.

- Select and configure virtual platforms (e.g., Zoom, Gather.town).
- Manage streaming, recordings, and on-demand access.
- Provide support for remote users; handle Q&A and interactions.
- Coordinate with Local Org for hybrid logistics.
- Collect feedback on virtual experience and improvements.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes robust, user-friendly setups adaptable to tech, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tools and integrations. This separation allows evolution with platform advancements.

- General Advice
  - Choose reliable platforms; test for accessibility.
  - Provide training for users; monitor for issues.
  - Integrate with in-person for seamless experience.
  - Collect feedback for iterative improvements.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Platforms: Zoom for sessions; Gather.town for networking; YouTube for livestreaming oral sessions.
  - Support: Dedicated help desks; hybrid coordination.
  - Feedback: Post-event surveys; real-time monitoring.
  - YouTube livestream benefits: Attendees late to morning sessions can watch live remotely, then catch up on missed content by rewinding. Very practical and well-received.

## Rationale & Consequences
Reliable virtual setups ensure inclusivity and engagement, preventing exclusion of remote participants. Inconsistencies can lead to technical failures or poor experiences.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable access and reliable interactions.
- If inconsistent/not done: Remote attendees disengage; technical issues disrupt flow.
- Alternatives: Fully in-person; multi-platform; AI moderation.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) Platform Selection and Setup
- Context: Choose tools that support hybrid goals.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with Tech Chairs).
- Options: Zoom vs Gather.town; integrated vs separate.
- 2025 decision: Zoom for sessions; Gather for networking.
- Pros/Cons: Zoom is familiar; Gather enhances interactions.
- Recommendations: Test compatibility; provide tutorials.

### 2) Content Streaming and Recording
- Context: Ensure high-quality delivery and archiving.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with Session Chairs, Publication Chairs).
- Options: Live only vs recorded; automated vs manual; streaming platform choice; archiving strategy.
- 2025 decision: Live with recordings; manual moderation; YouTube for livestreaming and archiving.
- Pros/Cons: Recordings increase access; live builds excitement. YouTube provides excellent rewind/replay capabilities for latecomers and persistent archiving.
- Recommendations: Use reliable streams; edit for on-demand. Post-conference archiving strategy: Publish session-level videos (oral sessions, special sessions, keynotes) + separate long talks (high-scoring papers) with proper titles for discoverability. Critical: obtain consent BEFORE conference for all recordings/uploads – much easier than retroactive requests.

### 3) User Support and Accessibility
- Context: Assist remote users for smooth participation.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with DEI Chairs).
- Options: Help desks vs self-service; inclusive vs standard features.
- 2025 decision: Dedicated support; accessibility features.
- Pros/Cons: Support ensures usability; self-service scales.
- Recommendations: Provide guides; monitor for issues.

### 4) Recording and Sharing Consent (Session-Specific)
- Context: Different session types have varying consent needs and sensitivities.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with relevant session chairs).
- Options: Blanket consent vs session-specific; opt-in vs opt-out.
- 2025 experience: Each session type has different considerations:
  - Tutorials: Asked presenters for YouTube upload consent post-conference; only upload if they agree.
  - Industry sessions: Industry PRs may not want public sharing; requires careful negotiation.
  - Keynotes: Speaker may or may not want public sharing; discuss during invitation.
  - Music program/Rencon: Performers and rights holders may have concerns; requires explicit consent.
  - Main paper sessions: Generally okay to share publicly (default for academic conferences).
- Pros/Cons: Session-specific respects varied privacy/commercial needs; blanket simplifies process but risks violations.
- Recommendations: Obtain consent BEFORE conference for ALL sessions – include recording/sharing terms in initial agreements with speakers/presenters. Create consent matrix documenting each session's sharing policy. Default to "no public sharing unless explicitly consented."

### 5) Integration with In-Person
- Context: Blend virtual and physical for cohesive experience.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with Local Org).
- Options: Parallel streams vs merged; chat vs voice.
- 2025 decision: Parallel with integrated Q&A.
- Pros/Cons: Parallel allows flexibility; merged ensures unity.
- Recommendations: Sync timings; test integrations.

### 6) Networking and Interactions
- Context: Facilitate virtual social connections.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs (coordinate with Social Media).
- Options: Dedicated spaces vs integrated; moderated vs open.
- 2025 decision: Gather.town for networking; moderated chats.
- Pros/Cons: Dedicated builds community; integrated leverages events.
- Recommendations: Promote early; gather feedback.

### 6) Evaluation and Improvements
- Context: Assess virtual program for enhancements.
- Decision owner(s): Virtual Chairs.
- Options: Surveys vs analytics; post-event vs ongoing.
- 2025 decision: Post-event surveys; internal reports.
- Pros/Cons: Surveys provide depth; analytics are quick.
- Recommendations: Track metrics; share insights.

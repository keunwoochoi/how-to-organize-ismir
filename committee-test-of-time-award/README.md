- Document process and lessons for future organizers.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes early planning and community involvement for timeless awards, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific categories and tools. This separation allows adaptation to evolving conference structures.

- General Advice
  - Start early (Month 5); appoint a committee chair for leadership.
  - Open nominations to community for transparency and inclusivity.
  - Handle CoI and ties with clear protocols; use metrics as tie-breakers.
  - Plan for multiple awards if consensus is split.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Categories: Classical ToT (2005-2008), 10-year ToT (2015); committee review via Slack.
  - Process: Community nominations; committee deliberations; GC facilitation.
  - Ceremony: During conference; presentations and plaques.

## Rationale & Consequences
Early initiation and structured processes ensure fairness and allow winner travel planning, maintaining award prestige. Inconsistencies can lead to rushed decisions, biases, or reduced participation.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures equitable evaluation and clear expectations for nominees.
- If inconsistent/not done: Delayed selections; perceived unfairness; missed opportunities.
- Alternatives: Board-led selections; automated metrics; single-category awards.

# **A Guide to Organizing the ISMIR Test of Time Award**

## **0\. The History**
The ISMIR 2024 Organizers initiated the ToT award, which was awarded to one paper among ISMIR 2000-2004 papers. We (ISMIR 2025 GCs) decided to continue and expand this into two categories:

 - Classical ToT award: From ISMIR 2005-2008 papers
 - 10-year ToT award: From ISMIR 2015 papers

The number of awards and the structure (awardee, runner-ups, and nominees) was determined after some diecussion among the GCs and the committee.

We anticipate the Classical ToT award can continue at ISMIR 2026 (from 2009-2011 papers) and complete at ISMIR 2027 (from 2012-2014 papers), while the 10-year ToT award to continue in every future ISMIR. This will make every previous ISMIR papers to be considered as a candidate of one of the ToT award. 

## **1\. Introduction**

This guide provides a recommended timeline and set of best practices for organizing the annual ISMIR Test of Time (ToT) Awards. It is based on the experiences and lessons learned from the ISMIR 2025 organization. The goal is to help future General Chairs (GCs) and Program Chairs (SPCs) run a smooth, fair, and successful award process, building upon the tradition established in previous years.  
The key to success is **starting early** and maintaining clear communication. This timeline assumes a 12-month cycle, beginning shortly after the conclusion of the previous year's conference.

## **2\. The 12-Month Timeline**

### **Months 1-4: Post-Conference & Initial Planning (e.g., October \- January)**

This is a quiet period for the ToT award itself. The primary focus for the new GCs is on the broader conference organization.

### **Month 5: Kick-off & Scoping (e.g., February)**

The process officially begins. Starting now prevents the last-minute rush experienced in previous years and gives awardees enough time to plan travel.

* **\[ \] Review Past Process:** The GCs should review this document and the notes from previous years to understand the history, rationale, and potential pitfalls.  
* **\[ \] Consult the ISMIR Board:** Engage with the ISMIR board to seek any official guidance or mandates for the ToT awards. This ensures alignment with the broader vision for the society's awards.  
* **\[ \] Define the Award Scope:** Formally decide on the scope for the year's awards. Based on the established precedent, this would likely be:  
  * **10-Year ToT Award:** For papers published exactly 10 years prior (e.g., in 2026, this would be for ISMIR 2016 papers).  
  * **"Classic" ToT Award:** Following the 4-3-3 year batching strategy to cover ISMIR's early years. For 2026, this would cover papers from **2009â€“2011**.  
* **\[ \] Set a Preliminary Internal Timeline:** Map out key deadlines from now until the conference.

### **Month 6: Committee Planning & Public Nominations (e.g., March)**

This month is about engaging the community and building the selection committee.

* **\[ \] Draft Call for Nominations:** Prepare a formal "Call for Nominations" to be sent to the public ISMIR community mailing list. This was a key piece of feedback from the board to make the process more transparent and inclusive.  
* **\[ \] Brainstorm Committee Candidates:** The GCs and SPCs should begin creating a list of potential committee members.  
  * **Criteria:** Look for senior, respected community members whose expertise covers the years in question.  
  * **Conflict of Interest (CoI):** Pre-screen candidates to ensure they do not have significant CoIs with potential nominees for the given years.  
* **\[ \] Select a Committee Chair:** **This is a critical step.** Appoint one person as the Committee Chair. This individual will be responsible for leading discussions, ensuring the committee meets its deadlines, and acting as the primary point of contact with the GCs. This avoids the potential for discussions to stall.  
* **\[ \] Send Call for Nominations:** Distribute the call to the ISMIR mailing list, with a clear deadline for submissions (e.g., end of April).

### **Month 7: Finalize Committee & Longlist (e.g., April)**

* **\[ \] Send Committee Invitations:** Contact potential committee members. The invitation should:  
  * Clearly state the timeline and expected workload.  
  * Identify the Committee Chair.  
  * Explain the scope of the awards for the year.  
  * Reiterate the policy on handling CoI.  
* **\[ \] Compile Nominations:** Gather all nominations from the community mailing list and from internal GC/SPC suggestions.  
* **\[ \] Finalize the Committee:** Confirm all members of the selection committee.

### **Month 8: Committee Deliberation (e.g., May)**

* **\[ \] Handover to Committee:** The GCs provide the complete, unredacted longlist of nominated papers to the Committee Chair. It should be stressed that this is a starting point and the committee has the autonomy to add to or debate the merits of all papers.  
* **\[ \] Committee Work Begins:** The Committee Chair takes over and leads the private deliberation process. The committee should decide on its own communication methods (e.g., a private Slack channel or email thread).

### **Month 9: Recommendations & Finalization (e.g., June)**

* **\[ \] Committee Submits Recommendations:** The Committee Chair delivers the final recommendations to the GCs. This should ideally include a clear winner, a runner-up, and potentially a short list of honorable mentions for each category. The recommendations should include a brief justification for each choice, drawing from the committee's discussion.  
* **\[ \] GCs & Committee Coordinate:** The GCs review the recommendations to ensure clarity. This is the time to resolve any ambiguities, such as ties. The GCs should facilitate a final decision but respect the committee's expertise and collective opinion.

### **Month 10: Notify Winners & Plan Ceremony (e.g., July)**

* **\[ \] Contact Awardees:** The GCs send official notification emails to the authors of the winning and runner-up papers.  
  * Use separate templates for winners and runners-up.  
  * The email should clearly state the award won and congratulate the authors.  
  * **Crucially, ask two questions:**  
    1. Will they be able to attend the conference?  
    2. Would they be willing to give a short (e.g., 10-minute) talk about their paper's impact?  
* **\[ \] Plan the Award:**  
  * Coordinate with the design chair to create a physical plaque or certificate.  
  * Discuss with the sponsorship chair if any small gift or prize will be offered.  
  * Begin planning the award presentation ceremony within the conference schedule.

### **Month 11: Finalize Logistics (e.g., August)**

* **\[ \] Confirm Attendance:** Follow up with awardees to confirm their attendance and participation in the talks.  
* **\[ \] Update Conference Program:** Lock in the time and place for the ToT award ceremony and talks in the official conference schedule.

### **Month 12: The Conference (e.g., September/October)**

* **\[ \] Present the Awards:** Host the ToT award ceremony at the conference. Have a committee member (ideally the Chair) or a GC present the awards and read the justifications.  
* **\[ \] Document the Process:** The current GCs should write up their notes, challenges, and final decisions to pass on to the next year's organizers, continuing the cycle of improvement.

## **3\. Key Lessons & Pitfalls to Avoid**

* **Start Early:** The single most important lesson. A start in February/March avoids rushed decisions and gives awardees time to make travel plans.  
* **Appoint a Committee Chair:** A designated leader is essential for keeping the committee's deliberations on track and ensuring accountability.  
* **Open the Nomination Process:** Involving the entire community in nominations makes the process more transparent and can surface papers the GCs/SPCs might have missed.  
* **Be Clear on Scope:** Decide early if you are awarding papers, people, or initiatives. The current precedent is paper-based awards to help solidify the tradition. Stick to this unless there is a strong directive from the board to change.  
* **Plan for Ties and CoI:** Discussions about top papers will be contentious. Have a plan for how the committee should handle ties or situations where a committee member has a conflict of interest. The GCs can help facilitate a final vote or use metrics like citation velocity as a soft tie-breaker, but the committee's consensus is paramount.  
* **One Award vs. Two:** For the "Classic" ToT covering multiple years, be open to awarding two papers if there is a strong split in the committee, as both may be monumental for different reasons. This is less of an issue for the 10-Year award.

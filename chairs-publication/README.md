# Publication Chairs Guide (grounded in Slack discussions)

## Goal
Maintain accurate, author-facing information and deliverables workflows. Coordinate poster specs, fun-fact submissions, reminders for missing assets, and slide deck logistics in sync with session operations.

- Keep Presenter & Author Instructions current
- Confirm and publish poster specifications
- Define and announce fun-fact policy and format
- Remind authors to complete required uploads via the submission system
- Coordinate slide deck access and session handoffs with volunteers/session chairs

## Chairs' Goal
Execute clear communications and lightweight processes that align with what other teams can support on-site and online.

- Update the Presenter & Author Instructions page (get repo/source early)
- Publish poster size/orientation once confirmed
- Set and announce fun-fact policy; coordinate how they are used during orals
- Query submission system (e.g., CMT) to identify missing deliverables and send reminders
- Ensure slide deck folder access and session handoff plans are clear (who opens/advances)

## Scope & Responsibilities (observed in Slack)
- Presenter & Author Instructions website updates (request repository/source)
- Poster specifications: A0 portrait confirmed and communicated
- Fun facts: policy converged to 1–3 per paper (previous 6–8 spec was not followed)
- Missing deliverables: email reminders to authors flagged by system queries; clear deadline
- Slide deck logistics: Google Drive folder access; volunteers/session chairs manage presentation flow on site; publication chairs provide guidance and announcements
- Presenter identification: if not collected in forms, session chairs/volunteers confirm just before sessions

## Rationale & Consequences
- Clarity in pre-conference communications reduces on-site friction
- If omitted: last-minute confusion on poster size, unused fun facts, missing files, and poorly coordinated session handoffs

## Suggested Timeline (general, assuming October conference)
- Month -8 to -6 (Feb to Apr)
  - Obtain repo/source for Presenter & Author Instructions; prepare initial page structure
  - Draft fun-fact policy (target 1–3 items) and poster spec section (populate after venue confirmation)
- Month -6 to -4 (Apr to Jun)
  - Confirm poster boards with Local Org; publish poster spec (e.g., A0 portrait)
  - Align with Scientific Program on author deliverables list and where they upload
- Month -3 to -2 (Jul to Aug)
  - Run submission-system queries to find missing deliverables; prepare reminder templates
  - Set up Google Drive slide deck folder structure and access; brief responsible leads
- Month -1 (Sep)
  - Send author reminders for missing files with a clear deadline
  - Finalize Presenter & Author Instructions; announce fun-fact policy and where/how it will be used
  - Align on session handoff plan: who opens/advances slides (volunteers/session chairs), and what backup the publication team provides
- Conference Week (Oct)
  - Support announcements and last-mile clarifications (fun facts usage, slide deck access)
  - Coordinate with volunteers/session chairs for smooth transitions in orals
- Post-conference (+1–2 weeks) (Oct to Nov)
  - Capture corrections to the Presenter & Author Instructions for next year
  - Debrief on what worked (policy clarity, reminders, handoffs)

## Dependencies & Blockers
- Submission system access and queries (e.g., CMT)
- Website repository/source for edits to author instructions
- Local Org confirmation for poster boards/specs
- Volunteer/session chair coordination for on-site slide operations

## Links (as referenced in Slack)
- Presenter & Author Instructions (prior year page used as example)
- Google Drive slide deck folder (shared access coordinated by organizers)

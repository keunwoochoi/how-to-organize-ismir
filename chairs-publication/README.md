# Publication Chairs Guide (grounded in 2025 Slack notes)

## Goal
Maintain accurate author-facing instructions and deliverables logistics. Coordinate poster specs, fun-fact submissions, slide deck assets, and missing-deliverables reminders.

- Keep the Presenter & Author Instructions page up to date
- Confirm and communicate poster specifications with organizers
- Define fun-fact submission policy and formats
- Nudge authors to complete required uploads before the conference

## Chairs' Goal
Operate author communications and deliverables workflows with clarity and minimal friction, using the tools and policies agreed in the organizers’ channel.

- Update the Presenter & Author Instructions website (request repo/source when needed)
- Confirm poster size/orientation and publish it
- Set the fun-fact policy (count and format) and announce it
- Use CMT to find and contact authors with missing files; set a clear deadline
- Manage access to shared slide deck folders and timelines

## This Year’s Choices (2025, from Slack)
- Presenter & Author Instructions: Request for website repo/source to update the page (ref: 2024 page used as example)
- Poster size & orientation: A0 portrait (confirmed)
- Fun facts policy: Ask authors for 1–3 fun facts per paper (discussion converged from older “6–8” spec to 1–3)
- Missing deliverables: Email via CMT to authors with incomplete uploads; used “<6 supplementary files” as criterion; deadline September 1 (AoE)
- Slide deck: Google Drive folder access coordinated; internal target to finalize by around September 19 (KST)

## Operational Notes (from Slack threads)
- Website source: Publication team asked for the repo/source to update the Presenter & Author Instructions page
- Context on fun facts: The older 2024 spec listed 6–8 items and file details; for 2025, organizers aligned on 1–3 items instead

## Suggested Timeline (2025-specific)
- By Sep 1 (AoE)
  - Send CMT reminder to authors with missing deliverables (based on CMT query/criterion)
- By ~Sep 19 (KST)
  - Finalize slide deck assets and access in Google Drive
- Pre-conference weeks
  - Update the Presenter & Author Instructions website with poster spec and fun-fact policy

## Dependencies & Blockers
- CMT access and queries to identify missing uploads
- Website repository/source for updating Presenter & Author Instructions
- Shared Google Drive for slide deck assets

Prompt suggestion (with uploading some log)

```
Based on this, write down a good summary for next year's organizers on this topic - [YOUR TOPIC e.g. best paper award, industry session, music session, etc.]. The goal is to give them a full-year guide about what to do when, what to be careful about, what not to miss, based on our experience and mistakes. a complete guide about how to work on Test of Time award, with a time line, assuming a whole year of preparation (after the end of this year's conference.) So, 12-month is the assumption, though no need to fully use the 12 month (e.g., it can start at month 2.)

Write it on the canvas, so that i can convert it to google doc later.

Every year's conference organizers are kinda new at organizing it. Be mindful about it.

Add some dependencies/blockers, or what each process might block other processes in organization. 

When it's relevant, add other chairs / people that they should talk to.

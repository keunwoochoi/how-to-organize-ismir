# How to Organize ISMIR

2025 Sep, Keunwoo Choi -- on behalf of the General Co-Chairs of ISMIR 2025 (Juhan, Dasaem, Keunwoo) and other organizers.

## Goal

The goal of this repo is to provide a detailed, useful guide for the next year's ISMIR organizers. As a general chair, I was surprised that many areas are not clearly defined on its goal, scope, and responsibilities.

This repo will be open to public. Do not include personal information or anything sensitive. If necessary, information can be anonymized. 

## The Semi-Automatic Creation of This Repo

We created two Slack workspaces for ISMIR 2025: One for the organizers, the other for the attendees. The organizers also used emails and google docs extensively as needed.

After the confernce is done, I exported all the chat data from both of the workspaces as well as all the relevant Google docs. They became the source data of the LLM. Then, I created subdirs for each areas as you see, and used Cursor to work on each of them. Initially I had to provide quite some guidance, and from one point I simply let the LLM finish all of them.

Finally - WIP - the organizers are reviewing the LLM-generated summaries and suggestions. Once that is done, this repo will be promoted to public & shared with the next year's organizers.

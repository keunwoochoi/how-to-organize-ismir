# How to Organize ISMIR

2025 Sep, Keunwoo Choi -- on behalf of the General Co-Chairs of ISMIR 2025 (Juhan, Dasaem, Keunwoo) and other organizers.

## Goal

The goal of this repo is to provide a detailed, useful guide for the next year's ISMIR organizers. As a general chair, I was surprised that many areas are not clearly defined on its goal, scope, and responsibilities.

This repo will be open to public. Do not include personal information or anything sensitive. If necessary, information can be anonymized.

# Volunteer Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Volunteer Program mobilizes community members to support conference operations, ensuring smooth execution while providing meaningful experiences and benefits. It fosters engagement, reduces operational costs, and builds a supportive network for ISMIR events.

- Recruit and manage volunteers for various conference roles to assist with operations.
- Provide guidance, support, benefits, and recognition to promote active participation and ensure a positive and balanced conference experience.

## Chairs' Goal

- Recruit volunteers through open calls and selection processes.
- Assign roles and shifts based on conference needs.
- Provide guidance, manuals, and ongoing support to ensure effective performance in each role.
- Manage volunteer benefits, communication, and on-site coordination.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties include recruitment, guidance, and operational support to ensure volunteers are prepared, engaged, and appreciated. Chairs manage applications, assignments, and communication while coordinating closely with session chairs.

- Define volunteer roles, requirements, and benefits
- Announce calls and manage applications.
- Select and assign volunteers.
- Provide guidance and task manuals for volunteers.
- Coordinate shifts, logistics, and on-site support.
- Manage volunteer benefits (e.g., registration, accommodation) and acknowledge contributions.
- Collect feedback and report on volunteer impact.

## General Advice and This Year’s Implementation
General advice outlines fair and efficient recruitment practices adaptable to conferences of any scale, while this year’s implementation reflects specific roles and benefits for volunteers in ISMIR 2025. This distinction supports flexibility across different needs and resources.

- General Advice
  - Use clear role descriptions and requirements to attract suitable volunteers.  
  - Provide detailed manuals and guidance; assign within-day shifts for flexibility.  
  - Offer benefits such as registration waivers or accommodations to encourage participation.  
  - Promote inclusivity and collect feedback for continuous improvement.  
- This Year’s Implementation (2025 Example)
  - Roles: Oral/poster support, transportation, registration, general assistance.  
  - Benefits: Free registration; acknowledgment on the website.  
  - Eligibility: In-person participation required (except for virtual volunteers).  
  - Application: Form due July 11; notification by July 18.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear processes and benefits ensure high volunteer satisfaction and reliability, preventing shortages or mismatches. Inconsistencies may lead to understaffing, volunteer dissatisfaction, or operational issues.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures fair selection and clear expectations for volunteers.  
- If inconsistent or not done: Low recruitment; poor performance; increased chair workload.
- Alternatives: Paid staff; automated tools for task assignments.

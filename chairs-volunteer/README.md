# Volunteer Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Volunteer Program mobilizes community members to support conference operations, ensuring smooth execution while providing valuable experiences and benefits. It fosters engagement, reduces costs, and builds a supportive network for ISMIR events.

- Recruit and manage volunteers for various conference roles to assist with operations.
- Provide training, benefits, and acknowledgment to enhance volunteer satisfaction and retention.

## Chairs' Goal
Volunteer Chairs must efficiently recruit, train, and assign volunteers to maximize contributions while ensuring fairness and inclusivity. Their focus is on matching skills, managing logistics, and delivering a positive volunteer experience.

- Recruit volunteers via calls and selections; assign roles and shifts.
- Provide training, manuals, and support for effective performance.
- Manage benefits, communications, and on-site coordination.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve recruitment, training, and event support to ensure volunteers are prepared and valued. Chairs handle applications, assignments, and feedback while coordinating with session chairs.

- Define volunteer roles, requirements, and benefits; publish calls and manage applications.
- Select and assign volunteers; provide training and task manuals.
- Coordinate shifts, logistics, and on-site support.
- Handle benefits (registration, accommodation); acknowledge contributions.
- Collect feedback and report on volunteer impact.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice promotes fair, efficient recruitment adaptable to conference scale, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific roles and benefits. This separation allows adaptation to varying needs and resources.

- General Advice
  - Use clear role descriptions and requirements to attract suitable volunteers.
  - Provide detailed manuals and training; assign one-day shifts for flexibility.
  - Offer benefits like registration waivers and accommodations to incentivize.
  - Promote inclusivity; collect feedback for improvements.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Roles: Oral/Poster support, Transportation, Registration, General.
  - Benefits: Free registration, limited accommodation; acknowledgment on website.
  - Application: Form by Jul 11; notification by Jul 18; in-person required.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear processes and benefits ensure high volunteer satisfaction and reliability, preventing shortages or mismatches. Inconsistencies can lead to understaffing, volunteer dissatisfaction, or operational issues.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures fair selection and clear expectations for volunteers.
- If inconsistent/not done: Low recruitment; poor performance; increased chair workload.
- Alternatives: Virtual volunteers; paid staff; automated tools for assignments.

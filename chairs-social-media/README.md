- Coordinate with sponsors and other chairs for integrated promotions.
- Manage social media accounts, permissions, and analytics.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice focuses on consistent, engaging strategies adaptable to platforms, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tools and integrations. This separation allows flexibility for evolving social media landscapes.

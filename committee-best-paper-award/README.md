## General Advice vs This Year's Choices

## Rationale & Consequences
Rigorous and transparent processes ensure credibility and motivation, preventing disputes or perceptions of unfairness. Inconsistencies can undermine trust and reduce the award's value.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures fair evaluation and clear expectations for nominees.

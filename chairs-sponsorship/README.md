# Sponsorship Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Sponsorship Program secures financial and in-kind support from industry partners, enhancing conference resources and fostering long-term collaborations. It provides value to sponsors while supporting conference operations and community benefits.

- Secure sponsorships to fund conference activities and provide sponsor benefits.
- Build partnerships that align with ISMIR's goals and promote mutual growth.

## Chairs' Goal
Sponsorship Chairs must attract sponsors, manage relationships, and deliver agreed benefits. Their focus is on value creation, compliance, and ensuring sponsors feel valued and engaged.

- Identify and secure sponsors; define tiers and benefits.
- Manage communications, deliverables, and feedback.
- Coordinate with Industry Chairs for event integrations.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve sponsor recruitment, benefit management, and relationship building to ensure successful partnerships. Chairs handle proposals, contracts, and evaluations while aligning with conference budgets.

- Define sponsorship tiers and benefits; prepare proposals and contracts.
- Recruit sponsors; manage communications and negotiations.
- Deliver benefits (e.g., registrations, promotions); track usage.
- Coordinate with Industry Chairs for booth/presentations.
- Collect feedback; report on sponsorship outcomes and ROI.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes value-driven, flexible models adaptable to budgets, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific tiers and benefits. This separation allows evolution with economic conditions.

- General Advice
  - Offer diverse benefits (registrations, promotions, booths) for appeal.
  - Communicate transparently; collect feedback for improvements.
  - Integrate with industry events for added value.
  - Track ROI for sponsors and conference.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Tiers: Registration-based sponsorships appreciated over booths.
  - Benefits: Registrations for staff; promotions; positive feedback.
  - Process: Proposals; contracts; post-event feedback.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear benefits and communications ensure sponsor satisfaction and repeat participation, supporting conference funding. Inconsistencies can lead to unmet expectations or lost opportunities.

- Why consistency matters: Builds trust and reliable value for sponsors.
- If inconsistent/not done: Sponsor dissatisfaction; reduced funding; missed partnerships.
- Alternatives: Crowdfunding; in-kind only; sponsor-led events.

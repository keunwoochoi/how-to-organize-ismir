# Grants Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Grants Chairs manage financial support programs to promote equitable access to ISMIR, enabling participation from students, underrepresented groups, and researchers from low- or middle-income countries who might otherwise face financial barriers. Grants include registration waivers, accommodation support, and travel coverage.

## Chairs' Goal (2025 specific accomplishments)
In 2025, the Grants Chairs successfully distributed 99 registration waivers (including 15 virtual), 44 accommodation grants, and 5 travel grants across four categories: Paper Authors, WIMIR (including Accessibility and Childcare), Music Authors, and LBD/Satellite Events. They developed a transparent two-stage ranking system based on eligibility criteria and implemented multiple confirmation mechanisms to ensure effective grant utilization.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Grants Chairs are responsible for establishing grant categories, determining eligibility criteria, managing the application process, evaluating applications using objective rubrics, allocating grants within budget constraints, coordinating with other chairs (especially Registration, Local Org, and Volunteer), arranging accommodation pairings, purchasing travel tickets when applicable, and communicating effectively with recipients to ensure confirmation and smooth logistics.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices

### General Advice (Evergreen Best Practices)
- **Transparent Criteria**: Establish objective, weighted scoring rubrics based on diversity and inclusion goals to ensure fair evaluation.
- **Early Planning**: Block accommodation early (before application deadline) despite late grant decisions, as prices increase closer to conference dates.
- **Multi-Stage Confirmation**: Implement multiple confirmation touchpoints (not just email) to verify recipients will attend and use grants.
- **Professional Logistics Support**: Engage a travel/logistics company to handle hotel bookings and flight arrangements; this workload is too heavy for chairs alone.
- **Clear Communication**: Explicitly state in all materials that accommodation grants are shared rooms (twin beds) to avoid surprises.
- **Flexibility**: Build in contingency for special accommodation needs (e.g., single room requests due to accessibility or personal circumstances).

### This Year's Choices (2025 Example with Context)
- **Grant Categories**: Four categories (Authors: 39+2 waivers; WIMIR: 23+7 waivers; Music: 2 waivers; LBD/Satellite: 15+6 waivers).
  - *Context*: LBD and satellite events were initially excluded from main grants process due to different review processes, but later included due to budget availability. Future years may want to allocate grants for these from the start, especially for first-time attendees.
- **Supporting Author Scoring**: 0.5 points if first author also receives grant; 1.0 if not.
  - *Rationale*: Prevents over-representation from single papers while still supporting teams.
- **Travel Grants as Pre-Purchased Tickets**: Purchased tickets directly rather than reimbursements.
  - *Trade-off*: Logistically simpler (avoids international money transfer complexities) but inflexible and budget unpredictable. Recommendation: Consider fixed-amount support (e.g., "up to $N with justification for higher costs") to incentivize economical choices.
- **Volunteer Waivers Separate**: Handled by Volunteer Chairs independently.
  - *Clarification*: Grants Chairs can still provide accommodation/travel to volunteers who apply if not covered by Volunteer Chairs.

## Rationale & Consequences

**Why Objective Scoring Matters**: Without clear rubrics, grant allocation can feel arbitrary, undermining trust and the conference's DEI goals. Weighted criteria make the process defensible and equitable.

**Why Early Hotel Booking Is Critical**: Prices skyrocket close to conference dates, and availability dwindles. Blocking rooms 6-8 months ahead saves significant budget even if final recipient list isn't ready.

**Why Multiple Confirmations Are Needed**: Email alone is unreliable (spam filters, summer inactivity). 2025 used Google Forms linked in emails, and even LinkedIn outreach in some cases, to confirm receipt and intent. Without this, wasted budget (unclaimed rooms) and last-minute scrambling ensue.

**Accommodation Pairing Nuance**: Pairing strangers requires care. Collecting preferences (gender identity, institutional connections, accessibility needs) via form and treating special cases with sensitivity turns potential stress into positive networking opportunities.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

This section details major decisions, providing context for future chairs. Each topic includes decision ownership, available options, 2025's approach, trade-offs, and recommendations.

### 1) Grant Categories and Eligibility
- **Context**: Decide which attendee groups qualify for grants and under which categories (e.g., paper authors, WIMIR, music authors, LBD authors, satellite event participants).
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs, DEI Chairs, Scientific Program Chairs).
- **Options**: 
  - Restrict to paper authors only (narrow).
  - Include WIMIR + author categories (standard ISMIR approach).
  - Add music authors, LBD, and satellite events from the start (inclusive).
- **2025 decision**: Initially excluded LBD and satellite events; added them later due to budget surplus. Music authors included as separate category.
- **Pros/Cons**: 
  - *Pros of inclusion*: Supports first-time attendees and underrepresented groups in non-traditional formats.
  - *Cons*: Complicates scoring (LBD review process differs from main papers); requires larger budget.
- **Open questions**: Should LBD/satellite authorship count toward "author grant" scoring or only WIMIR? How to balance first-time attendee priority with author achievement?
- **Recommendations**: Allocate a modest LBD/satellite budget from the start (e.g., 10-15 waivers) to avoid last-minute scrambling. Consider separate scoring or let it only affect WIMIR score to distinguish from peer-reviewed paper impact.

### 2) Eligibility Criteria and Weighting
- **Context**: Define specific criteria (student status, WIMIR categories, country income level, authorship, previous attendance, past grants) and assign weights.
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs (optionally coordinate with DEI Chairs and Board for alignment on diversity priorities, though not required in practice).
- **Options**: Equal weights vs differentiated weights; include/exclude "unaffiliated" status; count previous ISMIR attendance against score.
- **2025 decision**: 
  - **Eligibility weights** (each +1): Student, Underrepresented in MIR, Low/Middle-Income Country, Queer in MIR, Unaffiliated Researcher, Women in MIR, Accessibility Needs.
  - **Authorship**: First author +1; Supporting author +0.5 (if first author also gets grant).
  - **Previous attendance**: <3 conferences +1; Previous grant recipient -1.
- **Pros/Cons**:
  - *Pros*: Objective, transparent, balances diversity and newcomer support.
  - *Cons*: "Unaffiliated" was confusing (affiliation â‰  full funding); partial funding scenarios not captured.
- **Open questions**: Should ISMIR society board members/WIMIR initiative contributors get bonus points (up to a ceiling)? How to handle partial affiliation funding cases?
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Rename "Unaffiliated" to clarify (e.g., "No institutional support available").
  - Ask about affiliation and funding status separately to capture nuances.
  - Learn from ISMIR 2024's additional tie-breaking questions for future refinement.
  - Consider adding modest bonus points for active society contributors (capped to avoid dominating other criteria).

### 3) Types of Support and Two-Stage Allocation
- **Context**: Offer registration waivers, accommodation grants, and travel grants; applicants can receive up to two types. How to allocate when preferences conflict with availability?
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs.
- **Options**: First-come-first-served vs ranked allocation; single-stage vs two-stage process.
- **2025 decision**: Two-stage process:
  - *Stage 1*: Assign most desired grant type by ranking; if unavailable, assign next desired type.
  - *Stage 2*: Assign next desired type by ranking if slots remain.
- **Pros/Cons**:
  - *Pros*: Maximizes recipient satisfaction; ensures high-ranked applicants get priority.
  - *Cons*: Complex to manage; requires clear communication of process.
- **Recommendations**: Continue two-stage approach; clearly document process in internal sheets (see [example ranking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oCMtQX-DZtnIQ7aFJuPfqwpMJCRgi7eIC90H9vyRQqo/edit?gid=375826275#gid=375826275)).

### 4) Travel Grant Logistics: Pre-Purchase vs Fixed Amount
- **Context**: Travel grants are hardest to manage due to unpredictable ticket prices, varying departure locations, and logistical complexity.
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs, Finance).
- **Options**: 
  - Pre-purchase tickets (2025 approach).
  - Provide fixed amount (e.g., "up to $1500; higher with justification").
  - Reimbursement after conference (complicated by international transfer laws).
- **2025 decision**: Pre-purchased tickets through travel agency.
- **Pros/Cons**:
  - *Pros of pre-purchase*: Avoids reimbursement complexities; ensures recipient can attend.
  - *Cons*: Unpredictable budget; hard to find best prices; recipients may choose expensive flights; limited flexibility; sometimes travel agency gave ridiculous prices.
  - *Pros of fixed amount*: Predictable budget; incentivizes economical choices; fairer allocation (can support more people if individuals don't consume full amount).
  - *Cons*: Recipients bear risk of ticket price increases; may still need reimbursement process.
- **Recommendations**: Shift to fixed-amount model (e.g., "up to $1200 USD for travel; extensions possible with justification showing only reasonable flights exceed this"). Requires clear guidelines on what "reasonable" means (e.g., one layover <X hours). This balances budget predictability, recipient responsibility, and fairness.

### 5) Accommodation Pairing Process
- **Context**: Accommodation grants are shared rooms (twin beds, 5 nights). How to pair strangers respectfully and effectively?
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs (coordinate with Local Org for hotel arrangements).
- **Options**: Random pairing vs preference-based; single rooms for all (expensive) vs shared (affordable).
- **2025 decision**: Shared rooms; collected preferences via Google Form (gender identity, institutional connections, accessibility needs, compatibility factors).
- **Pros/Cons**:
  - *Pros*: Cost-effective; can create positive networking experiences if done well.
  - *Cons*: Requires sensitive handling; some recipients may have missed "shared room" notice and be surprised.
- **Recommendations**: 
  - State "shared twin-bed rooms" explicitly and repeatedly in all communications (website, form, emails).
  - Offer alternative for special circumstances (accessibility, strong preference for single room) with clear process.
  - Use detailed preference form to guide pairings; aim for meaningful connections.
  - Budget for a few single rooms as contingency for special cases.

### 6) Confirmation and Communication Strategy
- **Context**: Grant recipients may not check email, leading to wasted grants if unclaimed. How to ensure confirmation?
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs.
- **Options**: Email-only vs multi-channel (email + form + LinkedIn); single notification vs multiple reminders.
- **2025 decision**: Email with embedded Google Form link (ask for email confirmation); LinkedIn outreach in unresponsive cases.
- **Pros/Cons**:
  - *Pros*: Form provides explicit confirmation; LinkedIn ensures message is seen.
  - *Cons*: Extra work; feels intrusive to chase on social media (but necessary given summer inactivity and spam filters).
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Embed confirmation form in all grant notification emails.
  - Set clear deadlines (e.g., "confirm within 7 days or grant reallocated").
  - Send follow-up reminder 3-4 days before deadline.
  - Have backup list of ranked alternates ready to reallocate quickly.
  - Consider using conference registration system to automatically flag grant recipients' registration status.

### 7) LBD and Satellite Event Author Grants (Policy Development)
- **Context**: 2025 initially excluded LBD and satellite authors from main grants, then added them last-minute. Should this be formalized?
- **Decision owner(s)**: Grants Chairs (coordinate with LBD Chairs, Satellite Event Organizers, General Chairs).
- **Options**: Always exclude; always include from start; include only if budget allows.
- **2025 decision**: Excluded initially; added later (15+6 waivers).
- **Pros/Cons**:
  - *Pros of inclusion*: Supports first-time attendees and emerging researchers; LBD often showcases novel work.
  - *Cons*: Review process differs from main papers; may dilute author grant prestige.
- **Recommendations**: Include from the start with modest allocation (e.g., 15-20 waivers registration-only). Treat authorship as WIMIR scoring factor rather than "author grant" category to distinguish from peer-reviewed papers.

## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)
A phased timeline ensures timely preparation, fair evaluation, and smooth execution. Early planning for accommodations is critical, while grant decisions must align with registration deadlines.

- **Month -12 to -10 (Oct to Dec, prior year)**

  - Write handoff document with lessons learned, rubric refinements, and budget notes.
  - Archive ranking sheets and applicant data (following data retention policies).

## Dependencies & Blockers
Grants Chairs depend heavily on other teams for success. Budget approval from General Chairs and Treasurer is foundational. Registration Chairs provide waiver code systems. Local Org and travel agency handle hotel bookings and flight tickets. Scientific Program Chairs determine paper acceptance timeline, which governs grant deadlines. DEI Chairs align on diversity criteria. Volunteer Chairs coordinate on volunteer waivers. Delays in budget approval or hotel blocking jeopardize cost control; late paper acceptance notifications compress grant evaluation time.

- **Budget approval**: General Chairs, Treasurer (critical for determining number of grants).
- **Registration system integration**: Registration Chairs (for waiver codes).
- **Hotel and travel logistics**: Local Org, travel/logistics company (essential; too complex for chairs alone).
- **Paper acceptance timeline**: Scientific Program Chairs (author grant deadline must follow acceptance notifications).
- **Diversity criteria alignment**: DEI Chairs (ensure eligibility criteria match DEI goals).
- **Volunteer waiver coordination**: Volunteer Chairs (avoid duplication).

## Stakeholders
Grants Chairs collaborate with multiple teams to align priorities and execute logistics. Each stakeholder plays a distinct role.

- **General Chairs**: Approve budget, provide strategic direction on DEI priorities, arbitrate policy questions (e.g., whether to include LBD authors).
- **DEI Chairs** (optional collaboration): Potential alignment on eligibility criteria for WIMIR categories and promoting grants to underrepresented groups. In 2025, the main collaboration was providing waiver codes for WIMIR mentees; broader coordination on grant criteria was not needed but could be beneficial in future years if DEI Chairs have specific inclusivity priorities to integrate.
- **Registration Chairs**: Generate and manage waiver codes; track which grant recipients have registered; flag issues (e.g., recipient didn't use code).
- **Local Organization Chairs**: Coordinate hotel room blocks, arrange logistics for accommodation grant recipients, handle special accommodation requests (accessibility needs, dietary restrictions at breakfast).
- **Scientific Program Chairs**: Determine paper acceptance timeline (which governs author grant deadline); provide list of accepted paper authors for verification.
- **LBD Chairs**: Coordinate on LBD author grants if included; provide list of accepted LBD authors.
- **Music Chairs**: Coordinate on music author grants; provide list of accepted music submissions.
- **Volunteer Chairs**: Ensure no duplication between volunteer waivers and grants; clarify which team covers accommodation/travel for volunteers.
- **Social Media Chairs**: Promote grants application to maximize reach, especially to underrepresented groups.
- **Finance/Treasurer**: Approve budget; process travel agency payments and hotel deposits; advise on reimbursement feasibility (if considering reimbursement model).
- **Travel/Logistics Company**: Handle hotel bookings, flight ticket purchases, and related communications. Critical partnership; do not attempt to manage hotels/flights without professional support.

## Caveats / Pitfalls
Several challenges require proactive mitigation to avoid wasted budget, recipient dissatisfaction, or chair burnout.

- **Email Communication Failure**: Recipients may not check institutional email over summer; messages go to spam. Mitigation: Use confirmation forms embedded in emails; follow up via alternative channels (LinkedIn) if needed; set clear deadlines for confirmation.
- **Accommodation Grant Surprises**: Recipients may miss "shared room" notice and be upset about pairing. Mitigation: State "shared twin-bed rooms" repeatedly in all materials; collect pairing preferences early; offer alternatives for special cases.
- **Travel Budget Unpredictability**: Pre-purchased tickets make budget planning hard; recipients may choose expensive flights. Mitigation: Consider fixed-amount model (e.g., "up to $N") to control costs and incentivize economical choices.
- **Unclaimed Grants**: Recipients may ghost after receiving grant, wasting hotel rooms or registration slots. Mitigation: Require explicit confirmation; have ranked waitlist ready; reallocate quickly if no response within deadline.
- **Last-Minute Room Changes**: Grant recipient may cancel close to conference, leaving unpaired roommate. Mitigation: Book a few extra flexible rooms; maintain waitlist of alternates; be prepared to re-pair or offer single room upgrade.
- **Affiliation Ambiguity**: "Unaffiliated" is confusing; some have partial funding from affiliation. Mitigation: Revise form to ask separately about affiliation and funding availability; clarify in eligibility descriptions.
- **Chair Burnout**: Managing 100+ grant applications, accommodation pairings, travel tickets, and communications is overwhelming for small team. Mitigation: Have at least 2-3 chairs; engage professional travel/logistics company; use templates for emails; automate where possible (e.g., form-triggered confirmation receipts).

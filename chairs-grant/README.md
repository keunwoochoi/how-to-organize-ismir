# Grants Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Grants Program provides financial support to promote inclusivity and diversity in ISMIR attendance, enabling broader participation from underrepresented groups and those facing financial barriers. It ensures equitable access to the conference through targeted waivers, accommodations, and travel grants.

- Administer registration waivers, accommodations, and travel grants to support diverse attendees.
- Promote equity, diversity, and inclusion by prioritizing underrepresented and financially needy participants.

## Chairs' Goal
Grants Chairs must design fair selection processes, manage applications efficiently, and allocate resources transparently. Their focus is on equity, compliance with budgets, and maximizing impact for conference accessibility.

- Define grant categories, criteria, and quantities based on budget and priorities.
- Evaluate applications using weighted rubrics and assign grants via two-stage process.
- Coordinate notifications, confirmations, and reporting while ensuring privacy and diversity.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve policy setting, application management, and stakeholder coordination to deliver grants equitably. Chairs handle evaluations, allocations, and follow-ups while aligning with conference diversity goals.

- Define grant types, categories, and eligibility criteria; set quantities based on budget.
- Design and manage application forms, deadlines, and selection rubrics.
- Evaluate applications, rank candidates, and assign grants in two stages.
- Notify recipients, handle confirmations, and report aggregate data.
- Coordinate with other chairs for overlaps (e.g., Music grants, Volunteer waivers).

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes equitable, transparent processes adaptable to budgets, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific allocations and tools. This separation allows scaling for future years' resources and priorities.

- General Advice
  - Use weighted eligibility criteria to prioritize diversity and need.
  - Implement two-stage assignment to maximize satisfaction and slot usage.
  - Ensure privacy by reporting only aggregates; use confirmation forms for notifications.
  - Avoid pre-purchased travel tickets due to price volatility.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Categories: Author, WIMIR, Music, LBD/Satellite; 99 waivers, 44 accommodations, 5 travel.
  - Tools: Google Forms for apps; spreadsheets for ranking; email notifications with confirmations.
  - Deadlines: Author/Music by Jul, WIMIR by Jul, last-minute by Sep.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear criteria and processes ensure fairness and efficiency, preventing disputes and maximizing inclusivity. Inconsistencies can lead to inequitable outcomes, budget overruns, or low uptake.

- Why consistency matters: Provides transparency and trust in selection process.
- If inconsistent/not done: Biased allocations; applicant confusion; underutilized funds.
- Alternatives: Automated scoring tools; single-round assignment; need-based only.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) Grant Categories and Quantities
- Context: Balance budget constraints with inclusivity goals; align with conference priorities.
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs).
- Options: Fixed categories vs flexible; budget-driven vs need-driven quantities.
- 2025 decision: 4 categories with specific numbers; based on prior budgets.
- Pros/Cons: Defined categories simplify ops; flexibility allows adaptation but increases complexity.
- Recommendations: Survey past recipients; model on diversity data.

### 2) Eligibility Criteria and Rubrics
- Context: Prioritize underrepresented groups while ensuring fairness.
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs (coordinate with DEI Chairs).
- Options: Binary weights vs sliding scales; include/exclude past recipients.
- 2025 decision: 8 weighted criteria; past recipients penalized; two-stage assignment.
- Pros/Cons: Weights promote equity; complexity in scoring.
- Recommendations: Test rubrics with sample data; anonymize where possible.

### 3) Application and Selection Process
- Context: Manage volume and ensure timely decisions.
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs.
- Options: Manual ranking vs automated; open vs tiered deadlines.
- 2025 decision: Google Forms; spreadsheet ranking; two-stage assignment.
- Pros/Cons: Manual allows nuance; automated scales better but misses context.
- Recommendations: Use shared docs for collaboration; pilot process early.

### 4) Notification and Confirmation
- Context: Ensure recipients receive and confirm grants.
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs.
- Options: Email only vs with forms; automated vs manual.
- 2025 decision: Email with Google Form confirmation; track responses.
- Pros/Cons: Forms confirm receipt; emails are simple but unreliable.
- Recommendations: Follow up non-responders; use privacy-compliant tools.

### 5) Travel and Accommodation Handling
- Context: Provide support without financial risks.
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs (coordinate with Local Org).
- Options: Reimbursements vs pre-purchased; capped vs unlimited.
- 2025 decision: Pre-purchased accommodations; avoid pre-bought flights; 5 travel grants.
- Pros/Cons: Pre-purchased ensures attendance; reimbursements are flexible but risky.
- Recommendations: Set clear policies; monitor budget.

### 6) Reporting and Improvements
- Context: Track outcomes for future enhancements.
- Decision owner(s): Grants Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs).
- Options: Aggregate stats only vs detailed; internal vs public.
- 2025 decision: Aggregate reports; internal debriefs.
- Pros/Cons: Privacy-focused limits insights; detailed aids equity but risks breaches.
- Recommendations: Anonymize data; share lessons with successors.

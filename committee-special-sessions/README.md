# Special Sessions Committee Guide

## Note: Limited Source Information Available

**This guide is currently incomplete due to lack of source documentation from ISMIR 2025.** The committee-special-sessions area does not have detailed handoff materials, meeting notes, or Slack history to draw from. Future chairs should establish proper documentation practices to create a comprehensive guide.

## Goal
The Special Sessions Committee curates additional conference events, such as workshops, panels, or themed sessions, to enrich the program and address emerging topics. It expands ISMIR's scope, fostering interdisciplinary discussions and community-driven content.

- Organize workshops, panels, or special events beyond the main program.
- Enhance conference diversity and relevance through targeted sessions.

## Scope & Responsibilities (General Guidance)
Based on typical conference practices, Special Sessions Committees likely handle:

- Solicit and review special session proposals
- Coordinate with proposers for event planning and execution
- Integrate sessions into conference schedule
- Manage resources and logistics for special events

## Recording and Sharing Consent (Important Consideration)
Based on ISMIR 2025 experience, **recording and sharing policies should be decided separately for special sessions**, considering multiple factors:

- Session content may have commercial or competitive sensitivity
- Speakers/panelists may have varying comfort levels with public sharing
- Rights and permissions may be complex for certain topics
- **Recommendation**: Obtain recording/sharing consent BEFORE the conference during session planning phase, not retroactively

**To Future Chairs**: Please document your process thoroughly â€“ create meeting notes, decision logs, and handoff materials so future committees can build on your experience. This guide should be significantly expanded based on actual 2025 practices once that information becomes available.

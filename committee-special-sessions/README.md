# Special Sessions Committee Guide

## Goal
The Special Sessions Committee curates additional conference events, such as workshops, panels, or themed sessions, to enrich the program and address emerging topics. It expands ISMIR's scope, fostering interdisciplinary discussions and community-driven content.

- Organize workshops, panels, or special events beyond the main program.
- Enhance conference diversity and relevance through targeted sessions.

## Chairs' Goal
Committee members must identify opportunities, select proposals, and manage logistics. Their focus is on relevance, feasibility, and integration with the main conference.

- Identify and select special session proposals.
- Coordinate with proposers for event planning and execution.
- Integrate with conference schedule and resources.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve solicitation, evaluation, and management of special sessions to ensure quality and alignment. Committee handles proposals, selections, and support while coordinating with other chairs.

- Solicit and review special session proposals; select based on criteria.
- Coordinate with proposers for logistics, schedules, and resources.
- Integrate sessions into conference program; handle promotions.
- Provide support for hybrid formats and accessibility.
- Evaluate outcomes and report for future improvements.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes relevance, feasibility, and inclusivity adaptable to proposals, while this year's choices reflect 2025's specific selections and formats. This separation allows flexibility for varying interests.

- General Advice
  - Solicit broadly; evaluate based on novelty and fit.
  - Coordinate early for scheduling; ensure hybrid compatibility.
  - Promote inclusivity; collect feedback for iterations.
  - Align with conference theme for cohesion.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Proposals: Open call; selected based on relevance and feasibility.
  - Format: Hybrid; integrated with main schedule.
  - Support: Resources for logistics; promotions via social media.

## Rationale & Consequences
Structured selection ensures high-quality, relevant sessions that add value. Inconsistencies can lead to poor fit or resource mismatches.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures fair evaluation and clear expectations for proposers.
- If inconsistent/not done: Irrelevant sessions; scheduling conflicts; low attendance.
- Alternatives: Invitation-only; theme-restricted; post-conference events.

# Music Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Music Program features music and sound art performances, with an increasing emphasis on MIR technology integration in recent years to highlight its role in creative practices. It fosters artistic innovation, community engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration by curating diverse concerts that range from broad musical submissions to those deeply embedding MIR.

- Organize a concert program featuring music/sound art, often integrating MIR technologies.
- Encourage submissions that blend technology with artistic merit, evolving toward lecture-concert formats in recent years.

## Chairs' Goal
Music Chairs must curate high-quality submissions, ensure smooth execution of the concert, and promote MIR's role in creative practices. Their focus is on selection, coordination, and delivering an engaging, accessible program for both in-person and virtual audiences.

- Curate and select submissions that integrate MIR technology creatively and accessibly.
- Coordinate performances, tech support, and logistics for a hybrid concert format.
- Manage grants, registrations, and communications to support diverse participants.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core duties involve issuing calls, managing submissions, and overseeing the concert's technical and artistic aspects. Chairs handle selection, coordination, and execution while ensuring compliance with conference policies.

- Define themes and submission guidelines; publish CFP via web and email.
- Manage submission process, review proposals, and select pieces.
- Coordinate tech riders, venue resources, and performer needs.
- Oversee concert execution, including hybrid format and audience interaction.
- Administer grants and ensure registration for accepted submissions.

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice focuses on timeless strategies for inclusivity and quality, while this year's choices reflect specific adaptations for 2025's hybrid format and MIR emphasis. This separation allows for flexible, evolving practices across years.

- General Advice
  - Emphasize MIR integration as central to artistic merit, not just demonstration.
  - Set duration limits based on venue schedule and audience attention.
  - Provide clear tech support and resources to lower barriers for diverse creators.
  - Use grants to promote diversity in geography, experience, and need.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Theme: Lecture-Concert format with mandatory 1-2 min introduction.
  - Duration: <8 minutes; hybrid format with live interaction.
  - Grants: Based on quality, need, newness, diversity; early-bird registration perk.

## Rationale & Consequences
Clear themes and guidelines ensure submissions align with MIR's creative potential, preventing mismatches that could dilute the program's impact. Without them, the concert may lack cohesion or fail to engage, leading to lower participation or quality.

- Why consistency matters: Ensures fair review and clear expectations for submitters.
- If inconsistent/not done: Submissions may not fit the format; performers unprepared; audience disengaged.
- Alternatives: Fully open call without themes; stricter tech requirements for all.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make

### 1) CFP Themes and MIR Integration Requirements
- Context: Balance artistic freedom with MIR relevance to maintain program's identity.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs).
- Options: Broad themes vs specific tech mandates; optional vs required integration.
- 2025 decision: Lecture-Concert with mandatory MIR explanation; encourage but not limit to themes.
- Pros/Cons: Specific themes focus creativity; broad calls increase diversity but risk off-topic submissions.
- Recommendations: Pilot theme variations yearly; survey post-concert for feedback.

### 2) Submission and Review Process
- Context: Light review for accessibility vs rigorous for quality.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs.
- Options: Anonymous vs non-anonymous; peer review vs chair-led.
- 2025 decision: Non-anonymous; light review via system.
- Pros/Cons: Non-anonymous builds community; anonymous reduces bias but complicates process.
- Recommendations: Use rubrics for consistency; involve diverse reviewers.

### 3) Duration and Format Constraints
- Context: Venue time limits and hybrid logistics.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with Local Org).
- Options: Fixed slots vs flexible; in-person only vs hybrid.
- 2025 decision: <8 min; hybrid with live intro.
- Pros/Cons: Shorter times fit schedule; hybrid increases access but adds complexity.
- Recommendations: Test format in dry runs; adjust based on prior years.

### 4) Tech Support and Resources
- Context: Enable MIR integrations without overwhelming venue.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with Local Org).
- Options: Standard kit vs custom requests; on-site vs remote support.
- 2025 decision: Provide PA, projector, instruments; request tech riders early.
- Pros/Cons: Standard setups simplify ops; custom allows innovation but risks issues.
- Recommendations: Early coordination; budget for rentals.

### 5) Grants and Inclusivity
- Context: Promote diversity while rewarding quality.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with Grants Committee).
- Options: Merit-based vs need-based; capped vs unlimited.
- 2025 decision: Quality, need, newness, diversity; 100%/50% waivers.
- Pros/Cons: Balanced criteria ensure fairness; complex assessment.
- Recommendations: Transparent criteria; anonymous review.

### 6) Concert Execution and Interaction
- Context: Engage both in-person and virtual audiences.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with Virtual, Local Org).
- Options: Live chat only vs moderated Q&A; pre-recorded vs live priority.
- 2025 decision: Hybrid with live intro; chat for interaction.
- Pros/Cons: Chat encourages participation; moderation prevents spam.
- Recommendations: Rehearse hybrid elements; monitor engagement.

### 7) Waiver Expectations and Policies
- Context: Submitters often assume participation grants waivers, but it's not automatic; General Chairs discussed this extensively.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with General Chairs and Grants Committee).
- Options: Automatic waivers for all; case-by-case based on need; no waivers default.
- 2025 decision: Provided generous waivers despite no default policy; clarified in CFP and comms.
- Pros/Cons: Generous waivers increase participation; unclear expectations lead to disappointment.
- Open questions / follow-ups: Track waiver requests and outcomes for future policy.
- Recommendations: Explicitly state waiver policy in CFP; consider automatic for students or need-based.

### 8) Potential + Partial Integration with Jam Session (and Other Events)
- Context: Exploring integrations with other conference events (e.g., jam sessions, Rencon) to enhance MIR demos and cross-area collaboration, while preserving each event's spirit.
- Decision owner(s): Music Chairs (coordinate with relevant chairs/hosts, e.g., Jam Session Hosts, Rencon Chairs, General Chairs).
- Options: No integration; partial/selective invites; full merger; pilot with other events.
- 2025 decision: Invited two music teams to jam session for robot-human collaboration; ensured conditions to avoid disrupting jam spirit; considered Rencon but not pursued.
- Pros/Cons: Enhances visibility and synergy; risks diluting event focus or overcomplicating logistics.
- Open questions / follow-ups: Assess participant feedback; explore Rencon or other integrations (e.g., tutorials, panels).
- Recommendations: Start discussions early (Month -6); define integration criteria; pilot small-scale; survey for impact.

## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)

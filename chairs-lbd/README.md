# Late-Breaking/Demo (LBD) Chairs Guide

## Goal
The Late-Breaking/Demo (LBD) session serves as a platform for showcasing innovative but preliminary work in MIR, fostering community engagement and feedback. By organizing an in-person poster session, it provides a low-barrier entry for newcomers and early-career researchers to present prototypes, datasets, and initial concepts.

- Run an in-person LBD poster session for prototypes, early-stage research, datasets, and demos.
- Provide an accessible entry point for newcomers and rapid idea exchange.

## Chairs' Goal
LBD chairs are tasked with managing the entire lifecycle of the session, from initial planning to execution, ensuring a seamless experience for authors and attendees. Their primary focus is on efficient operations, clear communication, and high-quality on-site delivery.

- Oversee the end-to-end LBD workflow: submission, screening/selection, communications, and on-site execution.
- Keep policies coherent across channels and deliver a smooth author/presenter experience.

## Scope & Responsibilities
Core responsibilities involve defining policies, managing submissions, and coordinating logistics to maintain fairness and efficiency. Chairs must ensure all processes align with conference goals while handling operational details independently.

- Define and publish policy (capacity, format, screening cadence, resubmission policy)
- Keep specs consistent across web, email CFP, and submission system pages
- Operate screening; record decisions; open camera-ready; email authors
- Coordinate venue layout, poster boards, power/tables with Local Organization; scheduling with General Chairs
- Ensure delivery/validation of assets (poster, thumbnail, optional video); prepare on-site logistics

## General Advice vs This Year's Choices
General advice emphasizes scalable, transparent practices that can adapt to future conferences, while this year's choices reflect specific 2025 decisions based on available resources and constraints. This separation helps distinguish timeless strategies from contextual implementations.

- General Advice
  - Define capacity as a function of venue poster boards and safety margins (not a fixed number).
  - Prefer an open, auditable submission system (OpenReview) with clear forms and public timelines.
  - Choose screening cadence (rolling vs batch) to match capacity risk and staffing.
  - Avoid resubmission for simplicity; instead provide clear accept-with-notes guidance.
- This Year's Choices (2025 example)
  - Capacity: 75 posters (first-come-first-served)
  - Submission System: CMT (Author console → LBD); consider OpenReview next year
  - Video size: clarify one policy (conflict noted between 100MB email vs 350MB web)

## Rationale & Consequences
Consistency in policies and communications prevents misunderstandings and operational issues, ensuring a fair and efficient process for all participants. Without it, the session risks becoming chaotic, with increased support needs and potential inequities.

- Why consistency matters: mismatched specs create confusion, support load, and unfairness.
- If inconsistent/not done: authors submit wrong formats/sizes; missed deadlines; overload on-site logistics.
- Alternatives: batch deadlines with small review team; two-phase (EOI then camera-ready) if capacity tight.

## Topics to Discuss / Decisions to Make
Major decisions for LBD involve balancing efficiency, fairness, and resources, often requiring coordination with other chairs. Each topic below outlines key considerations, ownership, and recommendations to guide future planning.

### 1) Submission System (owned by Scientific Program; LBD impacted)
- Context: Platform affects forms, transparency, workflows, and author experience
- Decision owner(s): Scientific Program Chairs (coordinate with LBD, Web/Design, General Chairs)
- Options considered: CMT; OpenReview (moderated venue); hybrid
- 2025 decision: CMT; OpenReview recommended for future
- Pros/Cons (impact on LBD):
  - CMT: simpler setup, familiar; less transparent; limited form flexibility
  - OpenReview: transparent; flexible; requires moderation and earlier setup
- Recommendations: Engage Scientific Program by Month -7; align forms/specs across web/email/system

### 2) Screening Model (Rolling vs Batch; Resubmission Policy)
- Context: Capacity cap and staffing; need predictable throughput and fairness
- Options: Rolling screening with periodic decisions; Single batch deadline; Two-phase (EOI → final)
- 2025 decision: Rolling screening; no resubmission after rejection
- Pros/Cons: Rolling smooths inflow; Batch concentrates load; Two-phase improves forecasting but adds overhead
- Recommendations: Weekly decision SLA; templates; reserve a few slots for late-breaking demos

### 3) Capacity & Venue Logistics
- Context: Poster board limits; aisle safety; power availability; optional demo tables
- Options: Fixed cap; dynamic cap based on layout; split session across rooms/time
- 2025 decision: Cap at 75 first-come-first-served; consult GCs if slightly over
- Recommendations: Derive cap from board count × density × safety margin; pre-plan overflow handling

### 4) Author Deliverables and Media Specs
- Context: Posters, thumbnails, optional video with captions; accessibility
- Options: Strict single policy vs flexible ranges; optional vs required video
- 2025 decision: Poster required; thumbnail required; video optional; spec conflict observed; A0 poster size (ACL standard) worked well
- Recommendations: Publish a single spec table; align web/email/system; enforce at upload when possible; use A0 poster size for consistency with other conferences

### 5) Equipment Requests (Tables/Power)
- Context: Some demos need tables/power; limited venue drops
- Options: Collect requests in submission form; separate survey post-acceptance
- 2025 decision: Collect via form comments; accommodate best-effort
- Recommendations: Structured fields (table yes/no; power watts; plug type); coordinate with Local Org

### 6) Communications & Announcements
- Context: Need predictable timeline reminders; closure announcement when cap is near
- Options: Scheduled emails; web updates; Slack announcements (attendees channel)
- 2025 decision: Web + email; rolling notifications; announce early closure if near cap
- Recommendations: Template pack (CFP, reminder, acceptance, camera-ready, final info); public FAQ

## Suggested Timeline (assuming October main conference)
A phased timeline ensures steady progress from planning to execution, with key milestones tied to conference dates. Early focus on policy and tools prevents last-minute issues, while later phases emphasize monitoring and on-site prep.

- Month -8 to -6 (Feb to Apr)
  - Align on policy; update templates, review criteria, and submission forms
  - Decide screening cadence (weekly/biweekly) and comms plan
- Month -6 to -4 (Apr to Jun)
  - Publish CFP (web/email)
  - Prepare accept/reject email templates
  - Confirm poster board counts, layout, power availability with Local Org
- Month -3 (Jul)
  - Open submission system
  - Start screening
- Month -3 to -2 (Jul to Aug)
  - Monitor capacity; announce early closure if near cap
  - Camera-ready deadline; validate poster/thumbnail/video specs
  - Finalize on-site schedule, room layout, signage, volunteer support
- Month -1 to 0 (Conference week) (Sep to Oct)
  - Send final author reminders (check-in, poster specs, placement)
  - Prepare on-site materials (labels, map, check-in sheet); run session; record issues/attendance
- Post-conference (+1–2 weeks) (Oct to Nov)
  - Debrief; metrics (submissions, accepted, attendance); lessons learned; update guide

## Dependencies & Blockers
Successful execution relies on timely input from other teams, such as venue details and system setup, which can delay planning if not coordinated early. Identifying these dependencies upfront helps mitigate risks and ensures smooth operations.

- Poster capacity, layout, power availability (Local Organization)
- Website updates (Web & Design)
- Submission system configuration (OpenReview/CMT admin)
- Volunteer staffing for on-site logistics (Volunteers)

## Stakeholders
Collaboration with various chairs and teams is essential for aligning policies, resources, and communications. Regular check-ins with these stakeholders ensure shared understanding and timely support.

- General Chairs and Local Organization for the space information
- Web & Design for posting CfP and other information
- Volunteers to run the LBD session
- Social Media chair to promote the LBD session

## Caveats / Pitfalls
Common pitfalls arise from miscommunications, resource constraints, and process inefficiencies, which can lead to author frustration or operational overload. Anticipating these issues allows for proactive mitigation and smoother execution.

- Inconsistent specs across web/email/submission system (e.g., video size limits); unify policy
- Capacity reached before deadline; pre-draft closure messaging
- Screening backlog near deadline; enforce cadence
- Power/table requests unmanaged; capture via submission form early
